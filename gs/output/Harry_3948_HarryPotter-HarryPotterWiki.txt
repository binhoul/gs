In what proved to be <a href="/wiki/Attack_at_Godric%27s_Hollow_(1981)" title="Attack at Godric&#39;s Hollow (1981)">a vain attempt</a> to circumvent a <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney%27s_first_prophecy" title="Sybill Trelawney&#39;s first prophecy">prophecy</a>, that stated a boy born at the end of <a href="/wiki/July" title="July">July</a> of <a href="/wiki/1980" title="1980">1980</a> could be able to defeat him, Lord Voldemort attempted to murder him when he was a year and three months old, shortly after murdering Harry's parents as they tried to protect him. This early, unsuccessful attempt to vanquish Harry led to Voldemort's first defeat and the end of the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a>. One consequence of Lily's sacrificial protection is that her orphaned son had to be raised by her only remaining blood relative, <a href="/wiki/Petunia_Dursley" title="Petunia Dursley">Petunia Dursley</a>, where he was neither welcomed nor nurtured, but would stay alive, at least until he was seventeen years old. As the only known survivor of the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a> (up to that point) Harry was already famous before he arrived at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>.
</p><p>Early on his eleventh birthday, Harry learned that he was a wizard. He began attending Hogwarts in <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a> and was Sorted into <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> house. While at school, Harry became best friends with <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>, and later became the youngest <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> Seeker in over a century and eventually captain of his house's <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor_Quidditch_team" title="Gryffindor Quidditch team">team</a>, winning two <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_Cup" title="Quidditch Cup" class="mw-redirect">Quidditch Cups</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[11]</a></sup> He became even better known in his early years for protecting the <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a> from Voldemort and saving Ron's sister <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1994%E2%80%931995_school_year" title="1994–1995 school year">his fourth year</a>, Harry won the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>, although the competition ended in tragedy with the death of <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Rebirth_of_Tom_Riddle" title="Rebirth of Tom Riddle">return</a> of Lord Voldemort. The <a href="/wiki/1995%E2%80%931996_school_year" title="1995–1996 school year">next school year</a>, Harry reluctantly taught and led <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a> and fought in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, during which he lost his godfather, <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, who was a father/brother figure to him.
</p><p>Harry played a significant role in many other battles of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding War</a> and hunted down and destroyed Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a> along with Ron and Hermione. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, he personally witnessed the deaths of <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fred_Weasley" title="Fred Weasley">Fred Weasley</a> and learned that <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colin_Creevey" title="Colin Creevey">Colin Creevey</a>, and many others had fallen as well. He encountered Voldemort and sacrificed himself, knowing that his doing so was the only way to destroy the fragment of Voldemort's soul that was inside him. In Harry's near-death experience after Voldemort cursed him in the forest clearing, Dumbledore gave Harry advice and background information on Voldemort. When told he could choose to live or to "move on", Harry chose to live; after he awoke, he confronted Voldemort and defeated him once and for all.
</p><p>Harry was also notable for being the only known <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Death" title="Master of Death">Master of Death</a>, having united the three <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a> at the age of only seventeen.
</p><p>After the war, Harry became <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a> and married <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>, with whom he had three children; <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_II" title="James Potter II">James Sirius</a>, named after his father and godfather, <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">Albus Severus</a>, named after Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore, and <a href="/wiki/Lily_Potter" title="Lily Potter">Lily Luna</a>, who was named after his mother and good friend <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a>. Harry was also named the godfather of <a href="/wiki/Edward_Lupin" title="Edward Lupin">Ted Lupin</a>. He became Head of the <a href="/wiki/Auror_Office" title="Auror Office">Auror Office</a> in <a href="/wiki/2000s" title="2000s">2007</a> and occasionally went to Hogwarts to deliver <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> lectures.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Potter_family" title="Potter family">Potters</a> were an old and wealthy <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood" title="Pure-blood">pure-blood</a> family, and Harry inherited much wealth from his father <a href="/wiki/James_Potter" title="James Potter" class="mw-redirect">James</a>. The Potters descended from the <a href="/wiki/Peverell_family" title="Peverell family">Peverell family</a> through <a href="/wiki/Ignotus_Peverell" title="Ignotus Peverell">Ignotus Peverell</a>, who passed the <a href="/wiki/Cloak_of_Invisibility" title="Cloak of Invisibility">Cloak of Invisibility</a> on to his descendants. The Potters are related to the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Gaunt" title="House of Gaunt">Gaunts</a>, who are descendants of the second brother <a href="/wiki/Cadmus_Peverell" title="Cadmus Peverell">Cadmus</a>. From him, the <a href="/wiki/Resurrection_Stone" title="Resurrection Stone">Resurrection Stone</a> was passed onto his descendants as a family heirloom, set in a <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt%27s_Ring" title="Marvolo Gaunt&#39;s Ring">signet ring</a>.
</p><p>Conversely, Harry's mother <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">Lily Evans</a> was a <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a>, the first witch in her family.

</p><p>As the Potters were considered a pure-blood family, Harry may be related paternally to various other wizards and witches through families like the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Black" title="House of Black">Blacks</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_family" title="Malfoy family">Malfoys</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasleys</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Longbottom_family" title="Longbottom family">Longbottoms</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[12]</a></sup> as well as many other <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood" title="Pure-blood">Pure-blood</a> families.

<p>On the evening of Hallowe'en 1981, Voldemort arrived at Godric's Hollow and murdered James and Lily; he started with James, who tried to stand up to him; unfortunately he did not have his wand with him and was killed immediately. Lord Voldemort then advanced on Lily, who died protecting Harry. Her <a href="/wiki/Sacrificial_protection" title="Sacrificial protection">sacrifice</a> prevented the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a> from working on Harry. Additionally, her <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a> for Harry became a barrier protecting her son, when Voldemort attempted the curse on Harry, it backfired and instead of killing Harry Voldemort lost all his powers and his physical form was obliterated, but was saved from death by the five Horcruxes he had made up to that point. These included <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle%27s_diary" title="Tom Riddle&#39;s diary" class="mw-redirect">his diary</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt%27s_Ring" title="Marvolo Gaunt&#39;s Ring">Marvolo Gaunt's Ring</a>, <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_Locket" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s Locket" class="mw-redirect">Salazar Slytherin's Locket</a>, <a href="/wiki/Helga_Hufflepuff%27s_Cup" title="Helga Hufflepuff&#39;s Cup" class="mw-redirect">Helga Hufflepuff's Cup</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rowena_Ravenclaw%27s_Diadem" title="Rowena Ravenclaw&#39;s Diadem" class="mw-redirect">Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem</a><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[15]</a></sup> Later, this also included Harry himself because Voldemort not only gave part of his powers to Harry, he also accidentally gave part of his soul. This event made Harry the only person to have survived the Killing Curse, thus giving him the title "<i>The Boy Who Lived</i>". The failed curse left a <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_scars" title="Harry Potter&#39;s scars">lightning-bolt scar on his forehead</a>. The scar would be a bane and a blessing to Harry in the years to come, as it opened a <a href="/wiki/Mind-reading" title="Mind-reading">telepathic link between</a> Voldemort and himself.

As they were Muggles, they had no understanding of <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magic</a>, and even though his aunt and uncle knew about his lineage, they wanted absolutely nothing to do with it. The Dursleys considered themselves a "normal" family and despised anything out of the ordinary. They lied to Harry about his parents, claiming they had died in a car crash and that James was an unemployed drunk. When he tried to remember them, all he saw was a <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">green flash</a>. He tried to understand what it was, or if it was from the car crash, but he simply could not. Petunia and Vernon forbade Harry from asking questions, particularly those regarding his parents. In addition, the Dursleys refused to have pictures of Lily and James, and did their best to avoid the subject of Harry's parents altogether. 
</p><p>They resented Harry for his magic, which was sporadic, but evident. They discouraged any sort of imagination, insisting upon "<i>stamping that rubbish out</i>", and screamed at or punished Harry — sometimes by depriving him of meals — whenever something "unusual" occurred. The way he was treated bordered on abuse. In his youth, Harry could make strange things happen without understanding why he could, as no one had told him that he was a wizard. For instance, after Petunia sheared off all his messy hair using a pair of <a href="/wiki/Petunia_Dursley%27s_kitchen_scissors" title="Petunia Dursley&#39;s kitchen scissors">kitchen scissors</a> in fury that it would not lay flat, leaving him almost completely bald with only the fringe at the front, it had <a href="/wiki/Hair-regrowing_spells" title="Hair-regrowing spells">grown all the way back</a>, and to its previous messy state at that, by the next morning. Harry was punished, even though he had not done anything on purpose. Another time, <a href="/wiki/Dedalus_Diggle" title="Dedalus Diggle">Dedalus Diggle</a> bowed to him in a shop, and Petunia ferociously interrogated Harry as to how he knew the man before leaving the shop very quickly.

<p>The Dursleys spoiled and pampered their son <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley</a> and paid almost no attention to Harry; indeed, what little attention they did pay to him was entirely negative. All his clothes were hand-me-downs from Dudley and were far too large for Harry. He was forced to sleep in the <a href="/wiki/Cupboard_under_the_stairs" title="Cupboard under the stairs" class="mw-redirect">cupboard under the stairs</a>, while his cousin got two bedrooms to himself. They ordered Harry around like a slave for most of his childhood. In time, Dudley started bullying Harry. The Dursleys took Dudley and a friend to spectacular places every year for his birthday, but the only thing Harry got for his birthday was one of Vernon's old socks. The Dursleys also hid evidence of Harry's existence by not having pictures of him in the house. During the times that Harry wasn't being made to work or bullied, he was provided with little entertainment and sometimes tried to entertain himself by playing games such as <a href="/wiki/Solitaire" title="Solitaire">solitaire</a>.
</p><p>Harry's hardship, however, was necessary as by returning to live with his mother's only living blood relative, the <a href="/wiki/Sacrificial_protection" title="Sacrificial protection">protection</a> that Lily gave Harry would continue. While Harry could call that place home, he could not be harmed. However, this charm would be broken when Harry turned seventeen years old, or when he no longer called <a href="/wiki/4_Privet_Drive" title="4 Privet Drive">4 Privet Drive</a> his home. Furthermore, Harry's neighbour, <a href="/wiki/Arabella_Figg" title="Arabella Figg">Arabella Figg</a>, was a <a href="/wiki/Squib" title="Squib">Squib</a> working undercover for the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> to keep tabs on Harry's well-being. Unfortunately for Harry, to maintain favour with the Dursleys, she was forced to give him a lousy time whenever she had to look after him, as the Dursleys would never have let him go if they knew Harry was enjoying himself, a possibility that infuriated them.

Unfortunately for the Dursleys, they had to take Harry with them, as Mrs Figg had broken her leg and there was no one to take Harry, and they refused to leave him alone in their house. At the zoo, Harry unintentionally made the glass of an enclosure containing a boa constrictor disappear. This allowed the snake to slither out of his cage which scared Dudley into thinking it was after him. Harry was able to communicate with the freed boa in <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">Parseltongue</a>, which thanked Harry briefly, then slithered out of the reptile house calmly. After this incident, the enraged Dursleys sentenced Harry to his <a href="/wiki/Cupboard_Under_the_Stairs" title="Cupboard Under the Stairs">cupboard</a> until the beginning of the summer holidays.

<p>Harry had no birthday celebrations until the day he turned 11, which was the same day that he discovered the exceptional reality about his <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">identity</a>. The week of Harry's birthday, hundreds of letters began arriving at the Dursleys's home, addressed to him from a place called <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>. When the Dursleys saw the first letter was addressed as "<i>cupboard under the stairs</i>", they panicked at the thought of Harry's ill treatment being observed and transferred him to <a href="/wiki/The_Smallest_Bedroom" title="The Smallest Bedroom">Dudley's second bedroom</a>, which soon appeared on letters as the "<i>smallest bedroom</i>", When Harry's Uncle Vernon first read the letter, he turned a pale, <a href="/wiki/Porridge" title="Porridge">porridge</a> grey out of fear that wizards were trying to contact Harry. Because of this, <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Vernon Dursley</a> tried to destroy the letters in a futile attempt to keep Harry from his destiny. But the letters kept coming in increasingly larger quantities, to the point where they literally started flying out of the fireplace, and as they did, the Dursleys saw no alternative but to flee from them. This was not enough to enable the Dursleys to avoid the letters, as the <a href="/wiki/Owl" title="Owl">owls</a> carrying these letters followed them wherever they went. In a final desperate move, the <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">Dursleys</a> relocated themselves to <a href="/wiki/Hut-on-the-Rock" title="Hut-on-the-Rock">a shack</a> on a rocky island in the edge of the sea.

<p>Harry Potter was further guided by destiny when he met his lifelong best friends <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> while riding the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" title="Hogwarts Express">Hogwarts Express</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a> <a href="/wiki/Hatstall" title="Hatstall">took a while</a> to decide where to place Harry. It considered putting Harry into <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a>, but changed its mind at Harry's insistence, as he had heard about the Dark Wizards who had been in the house. All three were Sorted into <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> House on their first evening at school. While Harry immediately took to Ron, he did not immediately befriend Hermione, though he was nicer to her than Ron was. On Hallowe'en, a <a href="/wiki/Mountain_Troll" title="Mountain Troll">Mountain Troll</a> was let into the school. The students were sent back to their <a href="/wiki/Common_Room" title="Common Room" class="mw-redirect">Common Rooms</a>, but Harry realised that Hermione did not know about the Troll, since she was in the bathroom crying as Ron had made fun of her earlier in the day. Harry and Ron went to the girls' bathroom and found the troll bearing down on Hermione. After Harry stuck his wand up its nose, Ron was able to knock the troll out with its own club. Hermione lied to the professors when they came to investigate to keep Harry and Ron out of trouble. From that point on, the three were best friends.

<p>Harry discovered at his first <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broomstick</a> flying lesson that he was a natural flyer. When <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> took <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Remembrall" title="Remembrall">Remembrall</a>, Harry retrieved it using his broom to fly up and catch it. He was so skilled that he was able to join the <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor_Quidditch_team" title="Gryffindor Quidditch team">Gryffindor Quidditch team</a>, becoming the youngest <a href="/wiki/Seeker" title="Seeker">Seeker</a> in a century, since <a href="/wiki/First_year" title="First year">first year</a> students normally were not allowed to have their own <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broomsticks</a>. Before Harry's first <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> match, he received the new <a href="/wiki/Nimbus_2000" title="Nimbus 2000">Nimbus 2000</a>, a top of the line racing broom, from <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Professor McGonagall</a>. During that Quidditch match, Harry's broom was jinxed, and he <i>lost control</i>, which caused him to nearly fall off.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> saw <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professor</a> <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> staring at Harry and mumbling an incantation. <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> went to Snape's row and under his seat and cast <a href="/wiki/Lacarnum_Inflamarae" title="Lacarnum Inflamarae" class="mw-redirect">Lacarnum Inflamarae</a> causing the end of his robes to catch on <a href="/wiki/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a>. As soon as Snape stopped making eye contact with Harry, he regained control of his <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broom</a> and zoomed toward the ground. On his way, he caught the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Snitch" title="Golden Snitch">snitch</a> in his mouth, almost swallowing it, ending the match and leaving <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> victorious. It was later revealed that Quirrell was the one jinxing Harry's broom, and Snape was trying to perform a counter-jinx, much to Harry, Ron, and Hermione's surprise. Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, long presumed dead, was secretly mounting a return using the new <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professor</a> of <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a>, as a host body, he was able to search for the <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a>, which he believed would restore him to his body and grant him everlasting life. Voldemort was thwarted by Harry, with the help of Ron and Hermione.

<p>Throughout the challenges the group was picked off and in the final task Harry was left on his own when Hermione was unable to pass through, this left Harry to face <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> alone. Harry and Quirrell (who had been harbouring Voldemort with him all year) fought one another and Harry learned of his mother's protective charm when he blistered Quirrell's face by touching it with his hands.
</p><p>Overcome by his struggle for the Stone and his injuries, Harry then passed out, just as Dumbledore arrived and took the Stone. When Harry awoke in the hospital three days later, Dumbledore informed him that Quirrell had been abandoned by Voldemort, leaving him to die. During his unconsciousness in the Hospital Wing, Harry missed the last Quidditch match of the year: Gryffindor vs. Ravenclaw, the latter house winning. At the end-of-year feast, Harry was awarded an extra 60 points for Gryffindor by Dumbledore for pure nerve and outstanding courage, as Ron and Hermione were awarded 50 and Neville Longbottom 10, eventually winning Gryffindor the House Cup, breaking Slytherin's chance of winning a seventh year in a row.

<p>Harry's second year started out badly, and gradually got worse. Throughout the preceding summer, Harry had not been in contact with any of his friends, had heard no news from the wizarding world, and had been mistreated by his family, as usual. The Dursleys had gone so far as to ban Harry from saying words pertaining or related to magic in general. The Dursleys had also gained a fear of Harry's newly discovered magical abilities, which he often exploited in order to get them to leave him alone. The evening of his twelfth birthday, Harry learned that the reason his friends had not been in contact with him was that a <a href="/wiki/House-elf" title="House-elf">house-elf</a> named <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a> had been stopping letters from coming to Harry. When Harry questioned Dobby as to why, Dobby told him that Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts. Harry refused, saying the wizarding world was where he belonged, and Dobby set out to cause him trouble. During a business meeting between <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Vernon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mason" title="Mason">Mr Mason</a>, who brought his <a href="/wiki/Mason%27s_wife" title="Mason&#39;s wife">wife</a> with him, Dobby used his magical powers to drop Petunia's master-piece pudding, and then shortly afterwards disappeared, framing Harry for the chaos. Dobby's act of magic caused Harry to receive a warning from the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> and to be imprisoned in his room by the Dursleys. Despite their efforts, Harry was rescued by <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a> and his brothers, <a href="/wiki/Fred_Weasley" title="Fred Weasley">Fred</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_Weasley" title="George Weasley">George</a>. Harry had packed his bags and loaded the Weasleys' magic <a href="/wiki/Flying_Ford_Anglia" title="Flying Ford Anglia">flying car</a>. Harry and the brothers arrived at <a href="/wiki/The_Burrow" title="The Burrow">the Burrow</a> in the early hours of the morning, hoping not to be noticed. However, they were, and Mrs Weasley was furious.
</p><p>Dobby's first attempt at stopping Harry from returning had failed, so he continued trying. When Harry and the Weasleys arrived at <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Cross_Station" title="King&#39;s Cross Station">King's Cross Station</a>, Dobby sealed the entrance to <a href="/wiki/Platform_Nine_and_Three-Quarters" title="Platform Nine and Three-Quarters">Platform Nine and Three-Quarters</a> early and stopped Harry and Ron from passing through the wall to get on the Hogwarts Express. However, this did not stop Harry from returning to Hogwarts, as he and Ron used the Weasleys' <a href="/wiki/Flying_Ford_Anglia" title="Flying Ford Anglia">Flying Ford Anglia</a> to follow the train to Hogwarts. They arrived later than they had hoped, but all in one piece; until Ron accidentally drove the flying car into the <a href="/wiki/Whomping_Willow" title="Whomping Willow">Whomping Willow</a> and broke his wand.

<p>However, Harry's year at Hogwarts was destined not to improve in the least. Throughout the year, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, <a href="/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart" title="Gilderoy Lockhart">Gilderoy Lockhart</a>, humiliated Harry repeatedly by dragging Harry into the spotlight against Harry's will. During a duelling class led by Lockhart, Harry revealed himself to his fellow students and members of staff to be a <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">Parselmouth</a>, an uncommon skill that was normally associated with dark wizards. This brought on a great deal of trouble for Harry, since the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> had been re-opened, and it was the "Heir of Slytherin" who was deemed responsible. Once the chamber had been unsealed, there were various attacks on <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a> pupils, including Harry's best friend Hermione Granger.

<p>These attacks were believed to have been carried out by the heir, whom many believed to be Harry, but Harry believed that <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> was responsible. In order to prove their hypothesis, Hermione brewed <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a>, that Harry and Ron used to change their physical appearances to that of Crabbe and Goyle, so they could try to get information from Malfoy. They learned that Malfoy was not the heir and that he had no idea who the attacker was. Hermione, however, did not join the boys in this adventure as she had accidentally used a cat hair in her potion, causing her to spend weeks in the <a href="/wiki/Hospital_wing" title="Hospital wing" class="mw-redirect">hospital wing</a>. Prior to Valentine's Day, Harry discovered a <a href="/wiki/T._M._Riddle%27s_Diary" title="T. M. Riddle&#39;s Diary">diary</a>, and while writing in it, Harry learned that the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber</a> had been opened fifty years ago and that <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a> had been accused of the crime.
</p><p>By this time, Hermione had a different theory. She believed that the monster responsible for these attacks was a <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_Basilisk" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s Basilisk" class="mw-redirect">basilisk</a> and conducted research into her theory. The morning Hermione was attacked, she and <a href="/wiki/Penelope_Clearwater" title="Penelope Clearwater">Penelope Clearwater</a> had been using a mirror to look around corners for any attacking predator. Hermione had done enough research to figure that the basilisk had been moving around the school using the pipe system and scribbled her theory down on a scrap piece of paper torn out of a book.

<p>Still believing that if Hagrid were not responsible, he could at least point them in the right direction, Harry and Ron visited him after the attack on Hermione. From under the <a href="/wiki/Cloak_of_Invisibility" title="Cloak of Invisibility">Cloak of Invisibility</a>, they witnessed his arrest by <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a> <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a> and the suspension of <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a>. As Hagrid was being led away, he gave the pair a new clue. He told them to follow the <a href="/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a>. Harry and Ron heeded this advice, even though Ron was deathly afraid of spiders. They met <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a> who told them that Hagrid was not responsible for opening the Chamber the first time and that the girl who died was killed in a bathroom, leading Harry to theorise that <a href="/wiki/Myrtle" title="Myrtle">Moaning Myrtle</a> was the victim. A few days later, Harry and Ron discovered a scrap of paper in Hermione's hand, which was torn out of a book and described a deadly creature known as the Basilisk. Harry and Ron wondered how an enormous Basilisk would go around the school undetected, and then they saw the word "<i><b>pipes</b></i>" written on the scrap of paper.
</p><p>Harry (and later Ron) would soon learn that the person responsible for opening the Chamber was in fact Ron's younger sister, <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>, under the control of a <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">memory of Lord Voldemort</a> by writing into his diary, forcing her to torment and vandalise the school. They also learned that she was being kept down in the Chamber and were told that her "<i>skeleton would lie in the Chamber forever</i>", Determined to rescue Ginny and hopefully catch the Heir and destroy the Basilisk, Harry, accompanied by Ron and Lockhart, was able to locate and open the Chamber using his Parseltongue abilities. Once they got down into the Chamber, it was not long before the cowardly Lockhart attempted to erase Harry and Ron's memories using <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley%27s_first_wand" title="Ronald Weasley&#39;s first wand">Ron's broken wand</a>; however, his spell backfired, and he erased his own memory. The Chamber roof caved in, separating Harry from Ron and Lockhart.

<p>Separated from Ron and a now deluded Lockhart, Harry ventured on alone. Harry soon found Ginny's unconscious body lying on the floor of the Chamber. As he hoped, she was not dead; Harry was greeted by Tom Riddle, who had come to a simulation of life from the memories stored in the diary. Revealing his history and true nature as Voldemort, Riddle set the <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_Basilisk" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s Basilisk" class="mw-redirect">basilisk</a> upon Harry. He defeated the Basilisk with the help of <a href="/wiki/Fawkes" title="Fawkes">Fawkes</a> — <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a>'s phoenix — and <a href="/wiki/Godric_Gryffindor%27s_Sword" title="Godric Gryffindor&#39;s Sword" class="mw-redirect">Godric Gryffindor's Sword</a>.
</p><p>However, Harry was bitten by the Basilisk as he killed the wretched creature. Fawkes flew over to Harry and wept upon his wound. As phoenix tears had healing powers, Harry survived. Harry then stabbed the diary three times with the Basilisk fang to rid himself of Riddle, unknowingly destroying one of Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a> in the process. Riddle's manifestation exploded, therefore foiling his attempt to come back to life. Once the emergency was over, Fawkes flew Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Lockhart to safety. Harry spoke with Dumbledore on the events that had taken place, and explained to him that Ginny was not to blame and that Lockhart was a fraud. Harry and Ron both received Awards for Special Services to the School and two hundred points a piece for Gryffindor House.
</p><p>After interpreting Dobby's strange actions in Dumbledore's office, Harry realised <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> was the ultimate culprit for opening the Chamber. Before the term started, he had planted Tom Riddle's diary in Ginny's cauldron in the hope of indirectly opening the Chamber of Secrets. At this time, he did not know the diary was one of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. Afterwards, Harry was able to trick Lucius into freeing his mistreated <a href="/wiki/House-elf" title="House-elf">house-elf</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a>, who had been attempting to protect Harry all year, by giving him one of his socks.

This created a tense climate in the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a>, and many believed that murdering Harry was the object of Black's escape. As such, he was treated leniently when, late in the summer, he inadvertently inflated his <a href="/wiki/Marjorie_Dursley" title="Marjorie Dursley">"Aunt" Marge</a>, possibly with an <a href="/wiki/Engorgement_Charm" title="Engorgement Charm">Engorgement Charm</a>.

That night, Harry overheard <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Mr</a> and <a href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">Mrs Weasley</a> arguing and learned of the Ministry's fears that Harry was the target of Sirius Black.
</p><p>Prior to their departure aboard the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" title="Hogwarts Express">Hogwarts Express</a>, Mr Weasley pulled Harry aside and in no uncertain terms told Harry not to go looking for Black.

<p>The following day, Harry and his classmates began their new classes.

Trelawney also made a frequent habit of predicting very gruesome deaths for Harry, much to Harry's annoyance. On the other hand, there were courses in <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a>, during which <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a>, the new professor, taught them about <a href="/wiki/Hippogriff" title="Hippogriff">hippogriffs</a>. Unfortunately, <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> had not been listening when Hagrid lectured and was injured by the hippogriff, <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a>. Professor Lupin soon proved to be an excellent teacher in <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a>, where he taught the students how to combat various dark creatures. At Hallowe'en, the third year students went on their first visit to <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> village. Harry was not allowed to go, as he had not had his permission form signed. In light of Harry's difficulties, Ron and Hermione, who had been fighting over Hermione's new cat, <a href="/wiki/Crookshanks" title="Crookshanks">Crookshanks</a>, put aside their differences. While his friends were enjoying themselves in Hogsmeade, Harry visited with Professor Lupin. A few weeks later, Harry played in the first <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> match of the year versus <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a>. In the pouring rain and storms, the teams played until the Dementors invaded the field. In their presence, Harry tumbled off his broom fifty feet to the ground, and his <a href="/wiki/Nimbus_2000" title="Nimbus 2000">Nimbus 2000</a> was destroyed in the process.

<p>Just before Christmas, the school had another Hogsmeade visit. This time Harry sneaked out of the castle using the <a href="/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map" title="Marauder&#39;s Map">Marauder's Map</a>, which the Weasley twins presented to him in his time of need. During his illicit visit to Hogsmeade, Harry overheard a conversation between <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a> <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a> and several of the Hogwarts teachers. Fudge told them that Black had betrayed the Potters and that Black was still Harry's godfather. This revelation caused Harry great distress. To relieve Harry of some of his troubles, the trio went to visit Hagrid, where they learned that Buckbeak was to be put on trial, and they promised to help his defence. Soon after, on <a href="/wiki/December_25" title="December 25" class="mw-redirect">Christmas Day</a>, Harry received a <a href="/wiki/Firebolt" title="Firebolt">Firebolt</a>, a broom of extreme quality and high price, from an anonymous benefactor. Believing it to be from Sirius Black, Hermione reported it to <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Professor McGonagall</a>, causing Harry and Ron to stop talking to her.

<p>Following the break, Lupin began his <a href="/wiki/Anti-Dementor_lessons" title="Anti-Dementor lessons">lessons</a> with Harry. While Harry made progress, he regretted his inability to create a corporeal <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus</a> many lessons in. Soon after, Harry was given his Firebolt back by Professor McGonagall, and Harry decided it was high time to patch things up with Hermione. However, that same evening, Ron's rat, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Scabbers</a>, disappeared, and Ron blamed Crookshanks. Harry and Ron did not reconcile with her until after the next Hogsmeade visit, when Harry was almost caught. After receiving a stern talking to for sneaking out of the school, Harry and Ron emerged from Professor Lupin's office to find Hermione standing there looking distraught. She told them that <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> had used his influence and Buckbeak had been convicted and sentenced to execution.
</p><p>The Quidditch final was soon upon them, and Harry played in the dirtiest game of his career. He managed to catch the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Snitch" title="Golden Snitch">Golden Snitch</a> after Gryffindor was sufficiently ahead, and Gryffindor won the Quidditch Cup. They could not celebrate for long, as finals were right around the corner. Harry did well on his exams, and following his last final in <a href="/wiki/Divination" title="Divination">Divination</a>, Professor Trelawney went into a trance and predicted <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney%27s_second_prophecy" title="Sybill Trelawney&#39;s second prophecy">her second prophecy</a>, which stated that the <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">servant</a> would return to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> and help him return to power. The same day, Buckbeak's appeal had taken place in the castle, where the hippogriff was, again, sentenced to death. Against the advice of Hagrid, the trio went down to his cabin to comfort him. While there, Scabbers resurfaced. When he discovered that the Ministry officials were on their way, Hagrid rushed Harry, Ron, and Hermione out the back. While they made their way back to the castle, the sound of a swishing blade rent the air, and Buckbeak was apparently executed.

<p>Immediately afterwards, Scabbers bit Ron and attempted to escape, causing Ron to chase the rat into the shadow of the <a href="/wiki/Whomping_Willow" title="Whomping Willow">Whomping Willow</a>. Once there, he was attacked by a large black dog who dragged Ron and Scabbers into a tunnel under the Willow. Harry and Hermione followed them into the tunnel, which led them to the <a href="/wiki/Shrieking_Shack" title="Shrieking Shack">Shrieking Shack</a>. There, they followed the sound of Ron and discovered him in an upstairs bedroom, where they were ambushed by <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, who was revealed to be an <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagus</a> that turned into a dog. They were saved by <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Professor Lupin</a>, but then the situation turned on its head when he embraced Black like a brother, and they began talking about the long dead <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a>. When asked to explain, they revealed that Lupin, Black, and Pettigrew went to Hogwarts with Harry's father (<a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a>), that they had all become Animagi to help Lupin with his <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">lycanthropy</a>, and that in fact it was Peter Pettigrew who had betrayed the Potters. This was proven when Black and Lupin forced Scabbers to become Pettigrew.
</p><p>After questioning, Pettigrew confessed, but Harry prevented Black and Lupin from killing him. Determined to turn Pettigrew over, the whole group set off for the castle. Along the way, the <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">moon</a> came out from behind the clouds, and Lupin transformed into a werewolf, since he had not drunk his <a href="/wiki/Wolfsbane_Potion" title="Wolfsbane Potion">Wolfsbane Potion</a>. Seeing the danger, Black used his Animagus ability to protect Harry and his friends, but was badly injured. When Harry and Hermione went to look for him, hundreds of <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> fell upon them, trying to perform the <a href="/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss" title="Dementor&#39;s Kiss">Dementor's Kiss</a> both on Sirius and Harry. Sirius quickly passed out, as Harry tried casting the Patronus Charm (using the thought that he would leave the Dursleys and move in with Sirius to try and conjure it) and tried to make Hermione think of something happy and cast it as well, but neither could do it. The Dementors were quickly descending on them, and as Harry finally conjured a fog Patronus, Hermione passed out, leaving Harry to fight the Dementors alone. After trying to hold them off, Harry was quickly overwhelmed. The Dementors descended on him, Sirius, and Hermione. Then one Dementor grabbed Harry by the throat and attempted to perform the kiss on him. Harry then heard his mother screaming in his ears, thinking that she would be the last thing he ever heard, when a mysterious figure on the other side of the lake cast a powerful Patronus sending away all of the Dementors and saving Harry, Sirius, and Hermione.

<p>As he began to pass out, Harry began to think that the mysterious stranger was <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">his father</a>. Later, Harry and Hermione awoke to find themselves in the <a href="/wiki/Infirmary" title="Infirmary" class="mw-redirect">infirmary</a> and that Sirius was about to be subjected to the Dementor's Kiss. They pleaded with <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a>, who instructed them that nothing could be done without more time. With this clue, Hermione grabbed Harry and used her <a href="/wiki/Time-Turner" title="Time-Turner">Time-Turner</a> to send them back in time. Once there, they hid out until the time was right to <a href="/wiki/Rescue_of_Sirius_Black_and_Buckbeak" title="Rescue of Sirius Black and Buckbeak">rescue</a> Buckbeak, whom they saved just prior to his execution. Afterwards, they waited for the appropriate moment to save Sirius. While they sat in the woods, Harry tried to tell Hermione that he thought his father might have saved them. When Hermione reminded him that his father was dead, Harry dropped the subject. They ran for safety to <a href="/wiki/Hagrid%27s_hut" title="Hagrid&#39;s hut" class="mw-redirect">Hagrid's hut</a> when the werewolf Lupin was on the loose, and Harry, desperate to see who had saved him, left to observe the situation. Harry arrived at the lake watching the dementors attack his past self, until he in a flash of clarity realised that <i>he</i> had been the one he had seen cast the <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus Charm</a> that saved his life. Stepping forward, Harry cast the Patronus and produced a fully fledged <a href="/wiki/Deer" title="Deer">stag</a> Patronus that drove all of the dementors back — saving his past self, Hermione, and Sirius. Once reunited, the pair rode <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a> to Sirius's window and saved him.
</p><p>Harry returned to the Dursleys feeling as if he had accomplished nothing, but his trip and future at Hogwarts was brightened when he received a letter from Sirius. Inside there was permission for him to go to Hogsmeade, and Harry was delighted to have a godfather. Sirius also told him that it was indeed he who had given Harry the Firebolt.

<p>The night after the match, while the Irish team's supporters were still celebrating, a group of <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">black-cloaked, hooded figures</a> held terrifying celebrations of their own by suspending the <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">Muggle</a> camp site manager and his family in air like twisted marionettes. On Mr Weasley's orders, Harry fled into the woods near the camp site, along with Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny. The group was separated in the woods, and in the chaos, Harry had lost his wand. The trio ran into <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, and he all but told them that his father was among the cloaked wizards. Later, Harry learned that <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Jr." title="Bartemius Crouch Jr.">Barty Crouch Jr.</a> had stolen his wand from his pocket. While in a clearing in the woods, Harry, Ron, and Hermione heard someone shout the incantation <i><a href="/wiki/Morsmordre" title="Morsmordre">Morsmordre</a></i>, casting the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a> — a green skull with a snake protruding from its mouth like a tongue — into the sky. Although Harry did not immediately recognise its significance, he soon learned that the Dark Mark had evil implications. Then, Barty Crouch Sr., Amos Diggory, and other Ministry of Magic employees <a href="/wiki/Apparation" title="Apparation" class="mw-redirect">Apparated</a> into the clearing and began to question Harry, Ron, and Hermione about the Dark Mark. After Harry mentioned he had heard another voice conjure the Dark Mark, the Ministry employees searched the area and found the house-elf Winky unconscious in the bushes. Since Harry's wand was found in Winky's hand, Mr Crouch fired her for shaming his family and disobeying his orders.
</p><p>At the Hogwarts start of term feast, <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Professor Dumbledore</a> announced that <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> would host the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>, a recently revived inter-school competition in which the <a href="/wiki/Beauxbatons_Academy_of_Magic" title="Beauxbatons Academy of Magic">Beauxbatons Academy of Magic</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Durmstrang_Institute" title="Durmstrang Institute">Durmstrang Institute</a> would also participate. New rules stated that only students seventeen and older could compete. Also, during the start of term feast, Dumbledore introduced <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a>, an ex-<a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a>, as the newly appointed <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher. This news was greeted with a mixture of responses, as Moody was known to be a great <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a>, a little crazy, and to have a magical eye, earning him the nickname "Mad-Eye Moody". Around Hallowe'en, the students from <a href="/wiki/Beauxbatons_Academy_of_Magic" title="Beauxbatons Academy of Magic">Beauxbatons Academy of Magic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Durmstrang_Institute" title="Durmstrang Institute">Durmstrang Institute</a> arrived at the school, and <a href="/wiki/Viktor_Krum" title="Viktor Krum">Viktor Krum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur Delacour</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a> were all chosen to represent their respective schools in this tournament. However, Harry was mysteriously chosen as a fourth competitor, even though he was under-age and never entered his name into the <a href="/wiki/Goblet_of_Fire" title="Goblet of Fire">Goblet of Fire</a> during the selection process. Many people did not believe Harry's story, including <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>, believing this to be nothing but another attempt to gain fame. This caused extreme tension between the two friends. <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a>, on the other hand, "<i>accepted his story without question</i>", and assisted Harry in preparing for the Tournament by teaching him useful <a href="/wiki/Spell" title="Spell">spells</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Summoning_Charm" title="Summoning Charm">Summoning Charm</a>, which Harry used in the first task of the Tournament. The champions faced three dangerous challenges on their way to the Triwizard Cup. A few days after his name came out of the Goblet, Harry attended the <a href="/wiki/Wand_weighing_ceremony" title="Wand weighing ceremony">Wand weighing ceremony</a>. There he was cornered by the notorious <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Prophet" title="Daily Prophet">Daily Prophet</a></i> reporter <a href="/wiki/Rita_Skeeter" title="Rita Skeeter">Rita Skeeter</a>, who asked him many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leading_question" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:leading question">leading questions</a> and wrote an inflammatory article about him.

<p>In the first task, each champion needed to get past a <a href="/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> to collect a <a href="/wiki/Golden_egg" title="Golden egg">golden egg</a>.

Realising that every champion but <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric</a> had found out about the dragons, Harry told Cedric about the first task, trying to level the playing field. The newly appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a>, witnessed Harry telling Cedric, but did not report him.

Harry used a Summoning Charm to bring him his Firebolt and dodged the Hungarian Horntail to get the golden egg. Harry and <a href="/wiki/Viktor_Krum" title="Viktor Krum">Viktor Krum</a> tied for first at the end of the task. After seeing how dangerous the task was, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>, as well as the other students, made amends with Harry, with Ron telling him, "<i>I reckon someone is trying to do you in</i>".

They both ended up neglecting their dates, as Harry watched Cho with Cedric, and Ron was overcome with jealousy for Viktor Krum, who danced with Hermione.

She had overheard <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a> telling <a href="/wiki/Olympe_Maxime" title="Olympe Maxime">Madame Maxime</a> about his family.

Only after Harry, Ron, and Hermione proved that they still liked him did he return to work.

<p>To prepare for the second task, Harry had to open the egg he won from the dragon, but every time he did, it screeched. His rescue from that particular problem came when <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a> paid him back with the information that he would figure it out if he were to "<i>mull things over in the hot water</i>" with the egg. Harry followed this advice; while in the bathroom, he had an uncomfortable exchange with <a href="/wiki/Myrtle" title="Myrtle">Moaning Myrtle</a>, and on the way back to the Common Room, he ran into Professors <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Moody</a>. The latter informed Harry of <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Sr." title="Bartemius Crouch Sr.">Barty Crouch Sr</a>'s obsession with catching <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark Wizards</a>. Harry learned that the second task was going into the <a href="/wiki/Black_Lake" title="Black Lake" class="mw-redirect">Black Lake</a> to rescue "<i>the thing they would miss most</i>" from the <a href="/wiki/Merpeople" title="Merpeople">Merpeople</a>. Harry's new problem was that he had no idea of how to survive underwater for an hour. He got his answer in the form of <a href="/wiki/Gillyweed" title="Gillyweed">gillyweed</a> from <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a>, who had come to work at Hogwarts. For this task, Harry had to save his best friend <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>. When Harry reached Ron, he was shocked to find Hermione, Cho, and <a href="/wiki/Gabrielle_Delacour" title="Gabrielle Delacour">Gabrielle Delacour</a>, Fleur's sister, there as well. After Cedric and Viktor rescued Cho and Hermione, respectively, Harry hung around, and, concerned for Gabrielle, he saved her as well as Ron, landing him outside the hour allotted, but earning him points for "moral fibre". After the second task was finished, Harry and Cedric were tied for first. Viktor was in second, and Fleur was finshed in last.
</p><p>A month before the final task, the Champions were shown the beginnings of the challenge. They were told the third and final task was going into a maze filled with obstacles to find the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Cup" title="Triwizard Cup">Triwizard Cup</a>. On the way back to the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Castle" title="Hogwarts Castle">castle</a>, Krum took Harry aside to ask him something. Thinking that this was something important, Harry went with him. Krum then asked Harry about his relationship with Hermione, in whom Krum was deeply interested. Harry told him that there was nothing between him and Hermione and that she was just a friend. He also told Krum not to believe anything <a href="/wiki/Rita_Skeeter" title="Rita Skeeter">Rita Skeeter</a>, who had recently written in <i><a href="/wiki/Witch_Weekly" title="Witch Weekly">Witch Weekly</a></i> that there was a Harry-Hermione-Krum love triangle, wrote about him. That moment, Barty Crouch Sr. appeared in the forest disoriented and asking for Dumbledore. He disappeared when Harry went to fetch Dumbledore.

<p>To prepare for the final task, Harry, Ron, and Hermione used vacant classrooms to practise spells and jinxes. In <a href="/wiki/Divination" title="Divination">Divination</a> class between two of these study periods, Harry dozed off dreaming about Voldemort and left the classroom in a disturbing fashion. Rita Skeeter had witnessed this event, and she wrote, on the day of the final task, that Harry was disturbed and dangerous. This did nothing to boost Harry's morale, but when he spent the day with <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">Molly Weasley</a>, they cheered him up when they also came to watch the final task as his substitute family. During this final event, Hogwarts champions <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a> and Harry both showed supreme sportsmanship and cooperation despite the tension brought on by the maze and agreed to touch the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Cup" title="Triwizard Cup">Triwizard Cup</a> simultaneously, planning to tie for first place. They were unaware it was actually a <a href="/wiki/Portkey" title="Portkey">Portkey</a> and were transported to the graveyard in <a href="/wiki/Little_Hangleton" title="Little Hangleton">Little Hangleton</a>, the Riddle family's final resting place, where <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> was waiting.

<p>Harry was bound to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Sr." title="Tom Riddle Sr.">Tom Riddle Sr.</a>'s tombstone and forced to witness a ritual in which Pettigrew used some of Harry's blood to <a href="/wiki/Rebirth_of_Tom_Riddle" title="Rebirth of Tom Riddle">restore Voldemort's body</a>. At which time, the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> were summoned to the cemetery. After Voldemort regained a full-size human form and explained his downfall and disappearance to his followers, he engaged Harry in a <a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">duel</a>. Voldemort then tortured Harry with two <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curses</a> and then tried to kill him using the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a>. The nature of their wands' mystical connection caused their magical streams to interlock, which created an effect called <a href="/wiki/Priori_Incantatem" title="Priori Incantatem">Priori Incantatem</a>. After a battle of wills with Voldemort, Harry was momentarily shielded by the echoes of Lord Voldemort's previous victims, including Harry's parents and Cedric, with the last of whom asking Harry to return his body to his parents, which allowed Harry some time to grab Cedric's body and the Portkey and escape back to Hogwarts.
</p><p>It was uncovered that <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Jr." title="Bartemius Crouch Jr.">Barty Crouch Jr</a>, who had willingly taken the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a> as a young man, was throughout the school year disguised as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a>.

<p>Witnessing Cedric Diggory's murder was very difficult for Harry, and it was not helpful that he was forced back to number <a href="/wiki/4_Privet_Drive" title="4 Privet Drive">4 Privet Drive</a> on school holidays. To make things worse than they were already, in early August, <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">someone</a> sent Dementors to attack Harry in the Muggle town of <a href="/wiki/Little_Whinging" title="Little Whinging">Little Whinging</a>, in an attempt to neutralise him. He was forced to perform a <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus Charm</a> in order to save Dudley and himself. Subsequently, Harry was formally accused of performing under-age magic in the presence of a Muggle and was expelled, but thanks to <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>'s intervention, this was changed to a <a href="/wiki/Disciplinary_hearing_of_Harry_Potter" title="Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter">disciplinary hearing</a> in front of the entire <a href="/wiki/Wizengamot" title="Wizengamot">Wizengamot</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>. In a further attempt to discredit Harry, the Ministry changed the time and location of the hearing at the last minute, but Harry was able to make it there just minutes late. He was threatened with <a href="/wiki/Discipline_at_Hogwarts#Expulsion" title="Discipline at Hogwarts">expulsion</a> from Hogwarts, but was exonerated with help from Dumbledore, who had a witness and legal loopholes to help him.
</p><p>In retaliation against Dumbledore, <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a> <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a> appointed Umbridge, then Senior Under-Secretary to the Minister of Magic, as the new Hogwarts <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher so that she could spy on the school. She was later appointed <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_High_Inquisitor" title="Hogwarts High Inquisitor">Hogwarts High Inquisitor</a>, empowered to arbitrarily change and impose school rules whenever she chose. Moreover, every time Harry spoke out of turn, or even mentioned Voldemort, Umbridge threw him into detention, forcing him to write with her <a href="/wiki/Blood_Quill" title="Blood Quill" class="mw-redirect">quill</a>, that scribed the message "<i>I must not tell lies</i>" onto the back of his hand. However, she presumed the message failed to sink in, as Harry spread the word through <i><a href="/wiki/The_Quibbler" title="The Quibbler">The Quibbler</a></i> about the previous year's events, and thus he was banned from any more <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> visits.
</p><p>He was surprised when <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a> was chosen to be a <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">prefect</a>, not him, as <a href="/wiki/Fred_Weasley" title="Fred Weasley">Fred</a> always had expected Harry to be one. It was later revealed that Ron was chosen instead of Harry because Dumbledore thought that Harry had "<i>enough responsibility to be going on with</i>". Harry's jealousy threatened to affect his friendship with Ron, but he felt better when he discovered that his <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">father</a> was also not chosen as a prefect at school. This suggests that Harry's desire in becoming prefect was to emulate his father, who was <a href="/wiki/Head_Boy" title="Head Boy">Head Boy</a> in his day with his mother as <a href="/wiki/Head_Boy" title="Head Boy">Head Girl</a> respectively, not to inflate a sense of his own importance.

<p>Because Fudge stubbornly believed that Dumbledore was training an army to overthrow him, Umbridge had the Defence Against the Dark Arts class reduced to reading textbooks. Urged by Hermione, Harry secretly trained a group students in practical defensive magic. In an attempt to make light of the Ministry's fears, the group called themselves <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>, or the <i>D.A.</i> Feeling highly anxious and frustrated most of the time, Harry found that the D.A. was now his chief source of happiness, and the thing to which he looked forward throughout his school day. This happiness was felt by most members, as all of them, particularly <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>, gained a lot under Harry's tutelage. <a href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a> became a member, and before the Christmas holidays, she and Harry kissed under the <a href="/wiki/Mistletoe" title="Mistletoe">mistletoe</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Room_of_Requirement" title="Room of Requirement">Room of Requirement</a> after a D.A. meeting. This moment was confusing to Harry, as Cho, clearly still suffering from <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>'s death, had been crying during their kiss.

<p>However, Harry took on some much more pressing worries later that night. <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort" class="mw-redirect">Lord Voldemort</a>, wanting a "secret weapon" against Harry Potter, had heard of a <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney%27s_first_prophecy" title="Sybill Trelawney&#39;s first prophecy">prophecy</a> hidden in the Ministry's <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a> concerning both of them. Voldemort had been obsessing over the door to the <a href="/wiki/Hall_of_Prophecy" title="Hall of Prophecy">Hall of Prophecy</a> for the past few months, and had been inadvertently allowing Harry to read his thoughts through <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimency</a>. The link had been growing stronger for quite awhile. As a result, after falling asleep on the night of his kiss with Cho, Harry witnessed <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a> <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Arthur_Weasley" title="Attack on Arthur Weasley">attack</a> <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> in his dream, and felt almost as if he had been the <a href="/wiki/Snake" title="Snake">snake</a>. Realising what could happen if the link grew more powerful, Dumbledore commissioned Snape to train Harry in <a href="/wiki/Occlumency" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a> in an effort to prevent further problems. Unfortunately, Harry did not enjoy having his mind peered into and did not focus on using Occlumency, having indeed been extremely curious about the door himself. During a lesson in Occlumency, Snape stepped out of the room, and Harry's curiosity got the best of him. He looked into the <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore%27s_Pensieve" title="Albus Dumbledore&#39;s Pensieve" class="mw-redirect">pensieve</a>, which contained Snape's memories, and, to his dismay, Harry found images of his father bullying Snape. Snape himself discovered Harry's spying and refused to give him any more Occlumency lessons.
</p><p>As the second term progressed, Harry's relationship with Cho became more strained. While the two did like each other, Cho was mistakenly jealous of Hermione due to the latter's closeness with Harry, and Harry still felt awkward about Cho's feelings over Cedric. When Cho's friend, <a href="/wiki/Marietta_Edgecombe" title="Marietta Edgecombe">Marietta Edgecombe</a>, betrayed the D.A. to Umbridge, the members were all punished and forced to end their meetings. Harry was furious with Marietta, but Cho insisted on defending her friend. This was the final straw; at this point, Cho's and Harry's relationship "fell apart", and the two no longer saw each other romantically.
</p><p>During the final Quidditch match of the year — in which Harry did not play as Umbridge had banned him for life — <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a>, who had returned to the school months into the term and very badly beaten, decided to show Harry and Hermione why he was so badly injured. Hagrid had dragged a <a href="/wiki/Giant" title="Giant">giant</a> back with him from his mission over the summer. It transpired that the giant, named <a href="/wiki/Grawp" title="Grawp">Grawp</a>, was Hagrid's half-brother, and that Hagrid had been attempting to civilise the giant, but with few results. He made Harry and Hermione promise that they would look after Grawp should Hagrid be forced to leave the school. Hagrid was attacked and left the school during <a href="/wiki/Ordinary_Wizarding_Level" title="Ordinary Wizarding Level">O.W.L.</a> examinations, and Harry never had to go down to Grawp in the forest.

<p>Eventually, late in the O.W.L. examinations, Harry dozed off and received a vision of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> torturing <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius</a> and ordering him to get the prophecy. Harry was full of mind to go to the Ministry immediately, but Hermione advised him to check <a href="/wiki/Grimmauld_Place" title="Grimmauld Place">Grimmauld Place</a> first to see if Sirius was still there. Harry used the <a href="/wiki/Floo_Network" title="Floo Network">Floo Network</a> in Umbridge's office to peer into Grimmauld Place, where <a href="/wiki/Kreacher" title="Kreacher">Kreacher</a> stated that Sirius was gone. Unfortunately, Umbridge caught Harry and his friends in the act. She attempted to extract information via <a href="/wiki/Veritaserum" title="Veritaserum">Veritaserum</a>, which Snape claimed to have used up, before resorting to the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a>, revealing that it was she who set the Dementors loose on Harry. Hermione managed to save him by luring Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest, where Umbridge was dragged off by <a href="/wiki/Centaur" title="Centaur">centaurs</a> for insulting them. Harry and Hermione escaped when Grawp stumbled into the centaur camp looking for Hagrid.

<p>After reaching the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a>, Harry led them all through various rooms in search of Sirius, without finding him. The group became doubtful until they came across a room filled with crystal balls, later to be known as <a href="/wiki/Prophecy" title="Prophecy">prophecies</a>. One of the prophecies had Harry's name on it, and he picked it up, much to the displeasure of Hermione. Upon picking up the prophecy <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> appeared, revealing that it was all a ruse to bring him there. Chaos ensued, and all but Harry and Neville were incapacitated in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">fighting</a>. Then reinforcements from the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>, alerted by Snape, arrived to help aid in the battle.

Harry, enraged, pursued Bellatrix, using the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a>, but he was unable to kill her.

<p>Voldemort appeared, enraged by the failures of his Death Eaters. For the second time, he attempted to fatally curse Harry, who was too transfixed to even defend himself, but <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a>'s sudden arrival saved him. Voldemort then possessed Harry, hoping that Dumbledore would sacrifice Harry in order to kill Voldemort. However, Voldemort was forced to leave Harry's body when Harry grieved for Sirius, which Voldemort failed to understand. Voldemort then grabbed Bellatrix and <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">disapparated</a>, but <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">the Minister</a> and Ministry employees saw him first.
</p><p>Back at Hogwarts, Harry appeared in Dumbledore's office and tried to get out after <a href="/wiki/Phineas_Nigellus_Black" title="Phineas Nigellus Black">Phineas Nigellus Black</a> mentioned Sirius, only to find the door locked. Harry was none too pleased about Dumbledore's name being mentioned by the portraits. When the Headmaster returned, Harry lost his temper and started destroying Dumbledore's possessions, trying to get Dumbledore to let him out; Dumbledore refused, asking Harry to sit down and listen to what Dumbledore needed to say.
</p><p>Dumbledore explained to Harry the real reason why Voldemort tried to kill him as an infant. A prophecy stated that he was destined to defeat the Dark Lord, for he had powers Voldemort did not: the ability to <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a>, something that the Department of Mysteries was trying to research in a locked room. As a result of the battle, the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> realised that Lord Voldemort had indeed returned, and Harry and Dumbledore were vindicated. Serious steps were taken following this change in policy, such as the dismissal of <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>. However, this was not a sea change, as the Ministry still had a mistrust of Dumbledore.

<p>Early in his summer, Dumbledore requested that Harry join him in some unknown adventure and arrived to pick Harry up on a Friday, late in the evening. However, they could not depart immediately, because there was a piece of business to attend to: Sirius's <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black%27s_will" title="Sirius Black&#39;s will">will</a>. Much to his chagrin, Harry inherited his godfather Sirius Black's estate, including Grimmauld Place and the Blacks' melancholic and half-crazed house elf, <a href="/wiki/Kreacher" title="Kreacher">Kreacher</a>. They soon were off, and Dumbledore <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">apparated</a> Harry to the village of <a href="/wiki/Budleigh_Babberton" title="Budleigh Babberton">Budleigh Babberton</a>, where Harry was introduced to <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a>. In their time together, Harry and Slughorn discussed some of the professor's old students and the improved security at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>. When Harry and Dumbledore made to leave, Slughorn agreed to return to the school if he got a raise and a larger office. Following their visit, Dumbledore dropped Harry off at <a href="/wiki/The_Burrow" title="The Burrow">the Burrow</a>, where Harry spent the rest of the summer, but not before informing Harry that he was to be given special lessons by Dumbledore himself.

<p>Having learned of Professor Slughorn's propensity for hand-picking favourites, Harry experienced this first-hand when he was invited to join Horace Slughorn's <a href="/wiki/Slug_Club" title="Slug Club">Slug Club</a> during the ride to Hogwarts aboard the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" title="Hogwarts Express">Hogwarts Express</a>. He did not enjoy the experience, and made to leave as soon as possible. Instead of returning to his seat, Harry made to eavesdrop upon <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, who in a meeting weeks earlier had led Harry to believe he had taken the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a>. What he heard did nothing to dispel his suspicions. Arriving late to the <a href="/wiki/Welcoming_Feast" title="Welcoming Feast">Welcoming Feast</a>, due to an encounter with Malfoy, Harry learned that <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> had been promoted to <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> professor. While this disappointed Harry greatly, his career as an Auror reopened, as Professor Slughorn would accept his 'Exceeds Expectations' score in <a href="/wiki/Potions_(class)" title="Potions (class)">Potions</a>. As Harry had not bothered to buy a text book, Slughorn allowed Harry to borrow an old one from the supply cabinet. When Harry examined it, he found that it once had belonged to a student identified only as "<a href="/wiki/The_Half-Blood_Prince" title="The Half-Blood Prince" class="mw-redirect">The Half-Blood Prince</a>". The book contained copious handwritten notes that helped Harry excel in Potions for once. In fact, his skills won him a prize from Slughorn — a small vial of <a href="/wiki/Felix_Felicis" title="Felix Felicis">Felix Felicis</a>.
</p><p>Within the first week of school, Dumbledore made good on his promise of <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_Albus_Dumbledore%27s_private_lessons" title="Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore&#39;s private lessons">private lessons</a>. He informed Harry that they would be viewing memories of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> before he came to be known as Lord Voldemort, in order to learn his secrets and weaknesses. Dumbledore promised Harry that this information would help him survive and would prove crucial to the eventual defeat of Lord Voldemort. In their first lesson, the pair delved into the origin of the boy Tom Riddle in the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Gaunt" title="House of Gaunt">Gaunt family</a> around <a href="/wiki/Little_Hangleton" title="Little Hangleton">Little Hangleton</a>. The Saturday following Harry's first lesson, he assumed his Captain's duties holding open try-outs. After an arduous morning, Harry found three <a href="/wiki/Chaser" title="Chaser">Chasers</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>, two <a href="/wiki/Beater" title="Beater">Beaters</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a> as <a href="/wiki/Keeper" title="Keeper">Keeper</a>, who had survived with <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a>'s help. Throughout the autumn, Harry used Quidditch to dodge Professor Slughorn's <a href="/wiki/Slug_Club" title="Slug Club">Slug Club</a> events, doing this because he disliked the idea and because it was kinder than leaving Ron alone as Hermione had been invited, as well.

<p>Harry's lessons were quite sporadic that autumn, and he did not have another one until after tragedy befell someone at Hogwarts. In October, during a <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade_weekend_trips" title="Hogsmeade weekend trips">Hogsmeade visit</a>, <a href="/wiki/Katie_Bell" title="Katie Bell">Katie Bell</a> was nearly killed after being bewitched to carry a cursed necklace to Dumbledore. The following Monday, Harry shared his suspicions of Malfoy with <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> during their lesson, only to be rebuffed. That evening, Dumbledore focused on Tom Riddle just as he was on the cusp of his Hogwarts years, and Harry discovered a troubled orphan who consciously used his magic to bully and intimidate the other children. Not long after that meeting, Quidditch season was upon them. In preparation for their first game, Harry replaced the injured Katie Bell with <a href="/wiki/Dean_Thomas" title="Dean Thomas">Dean Thomas</a>. The change produced some results, both expected, as the team excelled on the <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_Pitch" title="Quidditch Pitch" class="mw-redirect">pitch</a>, and unexpected, as Harry found himself in a jealous rage after seeing Dean kissing Ginny after practice. The team's only problem was Ron, who was suffering from confidence issues. In an attempt to boost Ron's confidence, Harry blatantly acted as if he had spiked Ron's <a href="/wiki/Pumpkin_juice" title="Pumpkin juice">pumpkin juice</a> with <a href="/wiki/Felix_Felicis" title="Felix Felicis">Felix Felicis</a>. Ron took the bait and played a flawless match; however, Hermione took the bait as well and acted unkindly toward Ron and Harry. While she made up with Harry when he told her of the ruse, Ron's sudden relationship with <a href="/wiki/Lavender_Brown" title="Lavender Brown">Lavender Brown</a> led to continued strife.
</p><p>While Harry attempted to reconcile his best friends, the <a href="/wiki/Christmas_holidays" title="Christmas holidays">Christmas holidays</a> were fast approaching and with them the <a href="/wiki/Slug_Club_Christmas_party" title="Slug Club Christmas party">Slug Club Christmas party</a> out of which Harry could not wrangle. Since "The Chosen One" rumours had been printed, Harry had received an unnatural amount of attention from the young ladies at Hogwarts, specifically a <a href="/wiki/Fourth_year" title="Fourth year">fourth year</a> name <a href="/wiki/Romilda_Vane" title="Romilda Vane">Romilda Vane</a>. As Harry could not ask Ginny to the party, he was left to ask <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a> to attend with him as a friend. This hugely disappointed the gaggles of giggling girls who awaited Harry below every doorway with <a href="/wiki/Mistletoe" title="Mistletoe">mistletoe</a>. At the party, Harry was surprised to learn that Hermione attended with <a href="/wiki/Cormac_McLaggen" title="Cormac McLaggen">Cormac McLaggen</a>, a large <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> seventh year whom Ron despised, and told her that it served her right when he was less than gentlemanly.

<p>Harry's <a href="/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> was less than enjoyable, as he was cornered by the new <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rufus_Scrimgeour" title="Rufus Scrimgeour">Rufus Scrimgeour</a>. Scrimgeour had been hoping to speak with Harry for months and used <a href="/wiki/Percy_Weasley" title="Percy Weasley">Percy Weasley</a> as his in, interrupting the <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasley family</a> Christmas. He tried pitching Harry on becoming the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry</a>'s mascot, an idea that Harry was not prepared to accept. Upon returning to Hogwarts, Harry's sporadic lessons with Dumbledore continued. Early in January, Harry delved into a memory that all but proved that Riddle had killed his own paternal family after his <a href="/wiki/Fifth_year" title="Fifth year">fifth year</a> at Hogwarts. Then Dumbledore showed Harry a most curious memory, a memory that <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Professor Slughorn</a> had apparently tampered with, and he gave Harry his first homework assignment: to get the real memory from Slughorn. After impressing Slughorn using a <a href="/wiki/Bezoar" title="Bezoar">bezoar</a> in class, Harry tried the direct approach only to be instantly shot down.
</p><p>By <a href="/wiki/1_March" title="1 March">1 March</a>, Harry had still not acquired Slughorn's true memory and had begun to grow more obsessed with <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>. That morning he awoke to find Ron under the influence of a very powerful <a href="/wiki/Love_Potion" title="Love Potion">Love Potion</a>, and he took him to Slughorn, only for Ron to end up poisoned. This was enough for Hermione to overcome her animosity toward Ron, and the three became friends again. Ron survived, but was not fit for the upcoming Quidditch match, so he was replaced by McLaggen. This turned out to be a bad choice, as McLaggen accidentally knocked Harry unconscious mid-match. Upon his recovery, Harry had yet another lesson with the Headmaster. In it, he was upbraided by Dumbledore for not completing his assignment, witnessed the young Tom Riddle kill a <a href="/wiki/Hepzibah_Smith" title="Hepzibah Smith">woman</a> for the famous artefacts (<a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_locket" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s locket">Salazar Slytherin's locket</a> and <a href="/wiki/Helga_Hufflepuff%27s_cup" title="Helga Hufflepuff&#39;s cup">Helga Hufflepuff's cup</a>) she owned, and curse the <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> post at Hogwarts. However, Harry still could not figure out how to obtain the memory and focused on Malfoy. His interest was bordering on obsession, when Ron came up with the solution to Harry's dilemma with Slughorn: <a href="/wiki/Felix_Felicis" title="Felix Felicis">Felix Felicis</a>. In the evening, Harry took the potion and not only managed to obtain the memory, but also solved many of his and his friends's problems, including breaking up not only Ginny and Dean but also Ron and <a href="/wiki/Lavender_Brown" title="Lavender Brown">Lavender Brown</a>.
</p><p>Even though it was after midnight, Harry immediately went to Dumbledore with the new memory. It confirmed Dumbledore's theory that <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> had created multiple <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a> to ensure his <a href="/wiki/Immortality" title="Immortality">immortality</a>. Together, they theorised that the Dark Lord had created Horcruxes out of special objects such as <a href="/wiki/T._M._Riddle%27s_Diary" title="T. M. Riddle&#39;s Diary">Riddle's Diary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_locket" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s locket">Slytherin's Locket</a>. Before Harry left, Dumbledore promised to let Harry join him if he found another Horcrux. With the memory found, Harry had only Quidditch and Malfoy on his mind. In the week prior to the final Quidditch match, Harry discovered Malfoy crying in the toilet, and a <a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">duel</a> ensued. With Malfoy on the verge of using an <a href="/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses" title="Unforgivable Curses">Unforgivable Curse</a>, Harry cast <a href="/wiki/Sectumsempra" title="Sectumsempra">Sectumsempra</a>, a curse with unknown effects that he found in <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape%27s_copy_of_Advanced_Potion-Making" title="Severus Snape&#39;s copy of Advanced Potion-Making">the Half-Blood Prince's book</a>, nearly killing Malfoy and earning Harry indefinite Saturday <a href="/wiki/Detention" title="Detention" class="mw-redirect">detentions</a>. Unable to play, Harry waited with anticipation as he sat through his first detention. When he arrived back at <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor_Tower" title="Gryffindor Tower">Gryffindor Tower</a> he was happy to discover that they had won the <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_Cup" title="Quidditch Cup" class="mw-redirect">Quidditch Cup</a>, and spontaneously kissed <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny</a>, about whom he had been thinking quite often, when she embraced him in the post-match elation; this marked the beginning of their relationship.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/June" title="June">June</a>, Dumbledore led Harry out of the castle in search of a <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcrux</a>. From <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a>, they <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">apparated</a> to a sea-side <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Cave" title="Crystal Cave">cave</a>, where Tom Riddle had traumatised two young children from his orphanage in his youth. The cave was difficult to enter with a toll paid in blood, and to get to the island in the centre of the cave there was only a small boat, only made to fit one. Once on the island, Dumbledore found a basin that he could not remove the Horcrux from without drinking its contents. Dumbledore extracted a promise from Harry that he would force him to drink, no matter how much he tried to persuade him not to. With this promise, Dumbledore drank, and Harry watched as Dumbledore was driven out of his mind, but upheld his promise. When the basin was empty, Dumbledore asked for water which Harry was forced to get from the lake, triggering the <a href="/wiki/Inferius" title="Inferius">Inferi</a> that were waiting there. Panicking, Harry was dragged below, but was saved when an incredibly weakened Dumbledore conjured a firestorm that fended off the Inferi. They landed atop the <a href="/wiki/Astronomy_Tower" title="Astronomy Tower">Astronomy Tower</a> to discover that Hogwarts had been invaded by <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>, but Harry's friends Ron, Hermione, <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny</a>, who had been ordered to watch the school lest Malfoy accomplish his nefarious goal, battled alongside members of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> on the floor below Harry and Dumbledore, with some help from the remainder of Harry's vial of <a href="/wiki/Felix_Felicis" title="Felix Felicis">Felix Felicis</a>. Dumbledore had stopped Harry from fighting and frozen him against a wall, hidden underneath his <a href="/wiki/Invisibility_Cloak" title="Invisibility Cloak" class="mw-redirect">invisibility cloak</a>, so all he could do was watch.

<p>Harry witnessed the death of Albus Dumbledore at the hands of <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, and Dumbledore's body then plummeted from the tallest tower at Hogwarts. With Dumbledore dead, Harry was free of the spell that petrified him. He immediately set off after Snape, petrifying a Death Eater and seeking revenge. As the Death Eaters made their way out of Hogwarts Castle and on to the grounds, trying to reach the border where they would be able to <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">Apparate</a> again, Harry pursued and faced off against Snape. Harry tried many times to defeat Snape, even weakly attempting the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> and Snape's own hand crafted spells, all with no effect. In the process, Snape identified himself as the Half-Blood Prince, and escaped Hogwarts with <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> and the other Death Eaters. <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a> found Harry and together they managed to extinguish the fire that burnt Hagrid's hut (caused by <a href="/wiki/Thorfinn_Rowle" title="Thorfinn Rowle">Thorfinn Rowle</a>). Harry then told Hagrid that "<i>Snape killed Dumbledore</i>", but Hagrid refused to believe him. Harry (along with Hagrid) returned to the castle to find people staring at Dumbledore's crippled and lifeless body. Harry moved forward and found his mentor's body lying completely still on the ground and Hagrid finally believed him. Harry started to cry over Dumbledore's body where he was comforted by Ginny.
</p><p>Harry took the locket from Dumbledore's robes and was beside himself when he learned it was just a plain bit of jewellery, a decoy; there was a note inside the locket that revealed the real Horcrux was taken by someone called "<a href="/wiki/Regulus_Black" title="Regulus Black">R.A.B.</a>". It appeared to Harry that Dumbledore had died in vain and that they had achieved nothing that night. Ginny escorted Harry to the hospital wing on <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">McGonagall</a>'s orders, where he found <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville</a> apparently asleep in bed, as well as <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a>, <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Tonks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Lupin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poppy_Pomfrey" title="Poppy Pomfrey">Madam Pomfrey</a> and Ron's brother <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill</a> who had been horribly scarred by <a href="/wiki/Fenrir_Greyback" title="Fenrir Greyback">Fenrir Greyback</a>. When Ginny announced that Dumbledore was dead, everyone appeared horrified. Harry explained to everyone what had happened on the Astronomy Tower and when he was finished, they were all shocked by what he had said.
</p><p>Following the death of Albus Dumbledore, his funeral was carried out. Harry was disgusted to see that <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rita_Skeeter" title="Rita Skeeter">Rita Skeeter</a> had the nerve to attend his funeral, but he did not want to make a scene at Dumbledore's funeral and bit his tongue.
</p><p>Knowing that he would have to <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore_and_Harry_Potter%27s_Horcrux_Hunt" title="Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter&#39;s Horcrux Hunt">hunt down</a> Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a> and fearing for her safety, Harry took Ginny aside, and broke off their romance. Ginny told him that she did not care about the danger of being his girlfriend, but Harry still thought it was best if the two stopped seeing each other. He then spoke to Ron and Hermione, who committed to forgoing their final year at Hogwarts in order to accompany him, despite his protests.

<p>After securing the locket, the three friends took turns wearing it, to ensure it was not lost. The locket had a negative influence on all of them, straining relations and causing them to all act moody and inclined to get into petty arguments. They overheard a goblin saying that the sword protected by Snape was a fake.

<p>Harry and Hermione were excited at knowing what object they could use to destroy Horcruxes, but the locket's negative energy pushed Ron over the edge. Knowing that they now had something they were not close to destroying, Ron and Harry got into a horrible row, in which Ron accused Harry of not knowing what he was doing and not being very concerned when they learned that <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny</a> had been punished for attempting to steal Gryffindor’s Sword for them, along with <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a> and <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a>. Ron then abandoned his friends accusing Hermione of preferring Harry to himself.
</p><p>Ron’s departure left both Harry and Hermione depressed. After some listless time in which they accomplished nothing, they decided to head to <a href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Godric&#39;s Hollow">Godric's Hollow</a>, as Harry wanted to visit his parents graves, and Hermione had convinced herself that Dumbledore might have entrusted the Sword of Gryffindor to <a href="/wiki/Bathilda_Bagshot" title="Bathilda Bagshot">Bathilda Bagshot</a>, a magical historian who lived there and who had been friendly with the Potters and the <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore_family" title="Dumbledore family">Dumbledores</a>.

<p>They arrived on <a href="/wiki/24_December" title="24 December">Christmas Eve</a>. After seeing the <a href="/wiki/Potter_memorial" title="Potter memorial">memorial</a> dedicated to his parents, Harry and Hermione searched the graveyard for the Potters's grave and came across the grave of <a href="/wiki/Kendra_Dumbledore" title="Kendra Dumbledore">Kendra</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ariana_Dumbledore" title="Ariana Dumbledore">Ariana Dumbledore</a> and that of Ignotus Peverell. Harry was filled with regret that Dumbledore had not shared this connection with him. Upon discovering Harry's parents's grave Hermione called out to Harry and comforted him when he reached the grave. After placing a wreath on his parents’s graves, the two then met Bathilda, who motioned for them to follow her into her home. Believing Bathilda wanted to give him the Sword, Harry accompanied her upstairs alone when she indicated that Hermione should stay downstairs.
</p><p>Once there, she questioned Harry in what he did not realise was <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">Parseltongue</a>, revealing herself to in fact be <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a>, Voldemort's snake. Voldemort had murderd Bathilda and animated her corpse to hide Nagini, who attacked Harry, biting and coiling herself around Harry. Hermione raced upstairs and repelled the snake, while Harry’s <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_scars" title="Harry Potter&#39;s scars">scar</a> burned, alerting him to Voldemort’s approach. The pair managed to escape, but Harry was knocked unconscious and such a close call with Voldemort caused the connection to re-open and Harry had a vision of his parents' demise.

<p>During the brief skirmish with the Horcrux, a taunting Harry and Hermione appear, created by the Horcrux. The naked Harry and Hermione begin to kiss passionately, angering Ron, who then destroyed the Horcrux with the sword, casting the two away. As Ron had saved his life, Harry forgave him for leaving, and after seeing the Horcrux torture Ron, explained that he had no feelings for Hermione beyond that of a sibling. Hermione, who had been inside the tent during the destruction of the Horcrux, was angry with Ron for a longer period.

A <a href="/wiki/Skirmish_at_Malfoy_Manor" title="Skirmish at Malfoy Manor">skirmish</a> ensued upstairs, during which Harry took <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy%27s_wand" title="Draco Malfoy&#39;s wand">Draco Malfoy's wand</a> from him, and he and Ron saved Hermione and Griphook with Dobby's assistance.

<p>Following the death of Dobby, Harry, Ron, and Hermione stayed at <a href="/wiki/Shell_Cottage" title="Shell Cottage">Shell Cottage</a> for some time. During their stay, the trio formed a plan to <a href="/wiki/Break-in_of_Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank_(1998)" title="Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)">break into</a> the <a href="/wiki/Lestrange_Vault" title="Lestrange Vault">Lestrange Vault</a> to obtain the <a href="/wiki/Helga_Hufflepuff%27s_cup" title="Helga Hufflepuff&#39;s cup">Horcrux within</a>, with the help of <a href="/wiki/Griphook" title="Griphook">Griphook</a>. Due to the fact that Griphook would only help in exchange for <a href="/wiki/Godric_Gryffindor%27s_Sword" title="Godric Gryffindor&#39;s Sword" class="mw-redirect">Godric Gryffindor's Sword</a>, Harry decided to word his request so that the handover would not take place until after Harry had used it to dispose of the remaining <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>.
</p><p>Although feeling guilty for the deception, Harry knew that the sword was their only known weapon against the Horcruxes. The other residents of Shell Cottage could not fail to notice the trio's behaviour. <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill Weasley</a> took Harry aside and advised Harry to be cautious when making deals with Griphook who Harry was increasingly disliking. Around the same time, <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> came to Shell Cottage bearing tidings of new birth. He asked Harry to be the godfather of his newborn child, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Lupin" title="Edward Lupin">Ted Lupin</a>. It seemed as if the incident between them at <a href="/wiki/12_Grimmauld_Place" title="12 Grimmauld Place">12 Grimmauld Place</a> had never occurred

<p>The trio and Griphook left Shell Cottage early the next morning to break into Gringotts. Hermione disguised herself as notorious Death Eater <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>, using <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a>. The goal was to try and fool the goblins at Gringotts into believing that it was really Bellatrix who was entering the vault. The Trio had Bellatrix's wand that Harry had captured at Malfoy Manor as further proof for the disguise. Ron was <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">transfigured</a> to look like a foreign wizard named Dragomir Despard, and Harry had Griphook on his shoulders; both were under the Invisibility Cloak.

<p>Their plan proceeded reasonably well; Hermione made a convincing Bellatrix, despite a close encounter with a Death Eater named <a href="/wiki/Travers" title="Travers">Travers</a>, whose susipicions seemed to be eased and accompanied the group to Gringotts. Two human guards there had <a href="/wiki/Probity_Probe" title="Probity Probe">Probity Probes</a> that detected concealment charms, and Harry used a <a href="/wiki/Confundus_Charm" title="Confundus Charm">Confundus Charm</a> on them to get Hermione passed unchecked. Inside, the Goblins requested Bellatrix's identification. When Hermione hesitated, one nervously said that her wand was sufficient proof, though Hermione claimed it was new. Harry suspected the Goblins knew that Bellatrix's wand was stolen and were looking for an impostor.
</p><p>Griphook told Harry to use the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a>, he complied and <a href="/wiki/Bogrod" title="Bogrod">Bogrod</a> then accepted the wand as being correct.

The door slammed shut, and Harry sent Travers away to hide. Bogrod, still under the Imperius curse, summoned a cart that descended deep within Gringotts. After many twists and turns, the cart passed through <a href="/wiki/Thief%27s_Downfall" title="Thief&#39;s Downfall">Thief's Downfall</a>, a security waterfall that washed away all illusion charms. When the cart overturned and dumped them out, Hermione and Ron had been reverted to themselves.

<p>As Harry was setting himself down, he dropped both the Sword and the Cup. Griphook grabbed Gryffindor's Sword, and flipped Hufflepuff's cup up into the air.

Harry, Hermione, and Ron hurled curses at the Goblin throng. Harry released the half-blind Dragon and the three jumped on its back. The freed Dragon took flight, the three blasting holes into the ceiling for it to fly through as they made their escape.

<p>A vision from Voldemort helped Harry realise that the third Horcrux, whilst unbeknown to him at the time, <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw%27s_Diadem" title="Ravenclaw&#39;s Diadem">Ravenclaw's Diadem</a>, remained at Hogwarts. Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their final mission to return to the school and obtain the diadem, inadvertently tripping the <a href="/wiki/Caterwauling_Charm" title="Caterwauling Charm">Caterwauling Charm</a> upon apparating to <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> and thereby alerting the waiting <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> to their presence. Due to the trio being under the <a href="/wiki/Cloak_of_Invisibility" title="Cloak of Invisibility">Invisibility cloak</a>, however, the Death Eaters resorted to unleashing <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> into the streets to try to force the intruders out of hiding.
</p><p>Having no choice, Harry conjured his <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus</a> to protect himself and his friends, automatically giving away their position and confirming their identities (the Death Eaters having been pre-warned that Harry Potter's patronus took the form of a stag). As Death Eaters began to close in on the still invisible trio, <a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth Dumbledore</a> emerged from the <a href="/wiki/Hog%27s_Head" title="Hog&#39;s Head" class="mw-redirect">Hog's Head</a>, hurriedly telling the three to enter his pub. While Harry, Ron, and Hermione did so, Aberforth remained outside, proclaiming to the Death Eaters that it was he who tripped the alarm (by letting his cat out) and conjured the Patronus to ward off the Dementor threat; mockingly contradicting a Death Eater, saying that what he had seen was a goat Patronus rather than a stag. The incensed Death Eaters believed this and retreated.
</p><p>After Aberforth re-entered his pub and home, he scolded them for coming to Hogsmeade advising them to leave the country. After Harry engaged in a fierce argument with him, he led the grateful trio directly into Hogwarts through a secret entrance behind the portrait of his deceased sister, <a href="/wiki/Ariana_Dumbledore" title="Ariana Dumbledore">Ariana Dumbledore</a>. <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>, acting as their escort, then guided them into the <a href="/wiki/Room_of_Requirement" title="Room of Requirement">Room of Requirement</a>, where they were greeted by the reconstituted <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>; most of which were beaten and bruised yet ready to fight the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> controlling the school. Harry tried to tell them that he, Ron, and Hermione only returned to find something, but Neville contacted other allies with a call to arms. Harry was initially reluctant to allow the others to help, but in an attempt to be a better man than Dumbledore, whom he feared he was turning into, and after some discussion with Ron and Hermione, he allowed it.

<p>Harry hesitantly asked the room at large if they had ever heard of any sort of legendary artefact belonging to one of the Founders of Hogwarts. <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a> then elaborated on the fabled Diadem of Ravenclaw, pronouncing that a statue in <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw_Tower" title="Ravenclaw Tower">Ravenclaw Tower</a> depicted <a href="/wiki/Rowena_Ravenclaw" title="Rowena Ravenclaw">Rowena Ravenclaw</a> wearing a diadem. Harry, having no idea of what the diadem looked like, was led by Luna to the Ravenclaw Common Room to observe the statue. Here the pair were ambushed by <a href="/wiki/Alecto_Carrow" title="Alecto Carrow">Alecto Carrow</a> who pressed her <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a> immediately upon noticing Harry, summoning Voldemort, before Luna <a href="/wiki/Stunning_Spell" title="Stunning Spell">stunned</a> her from under the Invisibility Cloak. <a href="/wiki/Amycus_Carrow" title="Amycus Carrow">Amycus Carrow</a> attempted to force his way through the common room door, designed only to open after the door-knocker's question was correctly answered, by seeking the help of <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a>, who easily allowed him entry by solving the door's riddle herself; by that time, Harry had managed to rejoin Luna under the Invisibility Cloak.
</p><p>Amycus, in fear of his master's wrath, suggested framing Alecto's apparently mistaken summoning of the former on the Ravenclaw students; as he did, he spontaneously devised a lie that made it seem as though the students had forced Alecto to touch her Dark Mark at wand-point. In her outrage, McGonagall strongly insinuated that Amycus was a coward for proposing such an idea. Carrow spat in McGonagall's face in retaliation, utterly enraging Harry who suddenly revealed himself while momentarily casting the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> on the surprised Carrow, sending him flying backwards into the wall where he crumpled and fell unconscious. Harry then told McGonagall about the mission Dumbledore had left him, and she offered to hold Voldemort and his invading forces off, buying him the time he needed to search for the <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcrux</a>. All students of age, the D.A., and the members of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> who had arrived to fight prepared themselves for the impending siege. The <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> began as <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> and his army approached the outer boundaries of the school.

<p><a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, upon arrival at Hogwarts, demanded that the school turn over Harry, and the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> began. Harry realised that the positioning of <a href="/wiki/Alecto_Carrow" title="Alecto Carrow">Alecto Carrow</a> in <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw_Tower" title="Ravenclaw Tower">Ravenclaw Tower</a> confirmed the Horcrux's identity. It was the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. After thinking on it for some seconds, he went to ask the <a href="/wiki/Helena_Ravenclaw" title="Helena Ravenclaw">Grey Lady</a> about the diadem. From her information, Harry surmised that the Horcrux had been hidden in the Room of Requirement. Harry, in the meantime, was worried about Hermione and Ron, who seemed to have disappeared. They had gone into the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>, where Hermione destroyed Helga Hufflepuff’s Cup with basilisk fangs, which were one of the few weapons able to destroy Horcruxes.

<p>They fought their way to the <a href="/wiki/Shrieking_Shack" title="Shrieking Shack">Shrieking Shack</a>. Along the way, Harry witnessed many scenes of horror. On the grounds, Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> were waiting. After having seen so much pain and death, Harry could not summon the happiness required to conjure a <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus</a>. Neither could Hermione or Ron. In fact, Harry welcomed the oblivion that would come with the <a href="/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss" title="Dementor&#39;s Kiss">Dementor's Kiss</a>. But after seeing the patronuses conjured by <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Macmillan" title="Ernest Macmillan">Ernie Macmillan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Seamus_Finnigan" title="Seamus Finnigan">Seamus Finnigan</a>, Harry summoned the will to conjure his and managed to drive the Dementors away. Once the trio arrived at the Shrieking Shack, they witnessed Voldemort order Nagini to kill <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, as he believed that Snape was preventing him from being the true owner of the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a>. Before he died, Snape gave Harry memories to view in the <a href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a> and asked him to look into his eyes. Upon returning to the castle, Harry saw the corpses of <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a> near Fred's, and he felt devastated. He left his friends behind to use <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore%27s_Pensieve" title="Albus Dumbledore&#39;s Pensieve" class="mw-redirect">Albus Dumbledore's Pensieve</a>, welcoming the time in another's head.
</p><p>During a one-hour ceasefire, Harry viewed the memories given by a dying Snape, which revealed to him that he had inadvertently been turned into a <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcrux</a> himself and that Voldemort had to kill him in order to be rendered mortal himself. Harry also learned that Snape was, all along, with Dumbledore because he loved <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">Lily Evans</a>, since before they started school. Heavy of heart, Harry courageously slipped off on his own to carry out this dreadful task. He felt ghostly as he strode through the castle's empty halls, feeling as if he was already dead.
</p><p>As Harry passed the Great Hall, he could not see Hermione, Ron, or the other Weasleys, nor Luna. He felt he would have given anything for one last look at them, but then he thought he would never be able to stop looking. During his way to Voldemort, he saw the corpse of <a href="/wiki/Colin_Creevey" title="Colin Creevey">Colin Creevey</a> and told <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville</a> to kill <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a>, if he could. He passed Ginny, who was comforting a small girl, and almost wished she could have sensed him, but under the Invisibility Cloak, this was impossible. As he passed Hagrid's hut on the Grounds, he emotionally remembered his trips there, particularly rock cakes, Ron vomiting slugs, and Norbert.

<p>However, the "death" he met was not permanent: the blood Voldemort had taken from Harry to restore his physical form in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a> still contained the Bond of Blood, anchoring him to life and protecting Harry from Voldemort's curse, and his willingness to die triggered protections on the people of Hogwarts similar to the protections he received from his <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">mother</a>'s sacrifice. Also, since he had part of Voldemort's soul in him, Voldemort's Killing Curse unknowingly destroyed the part of Voldemort's soul, leaving one Horcrux left. Harry entered a state of <a href="/wiki/Limbo" title="Limbo">limbo</a>, where he met the spirit of Albus Dumbledore and the piece of Voldemort's soul that had just been destroyed. Dumbledore explained everything to Harry saying that he had "<i>no more secrets from [Harry]</i>". After reconciling with his mentor, Harry made the choice to return to the physical world rather than go on to the afterlife with Dumbledore.

<p><a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a> courageously stood up to Voldemort, and when the latter offered Neville a rank in his Death Eater society, Neville proudly refused and screamed to the high heavens, "<i>Dumbledore's Army!</i>" Voldemort cast the Full body-Bind Curse, then Summoned the Sorting Hat and placed it upon Neville's head. After he announced that there would be no houses and that the school colours would be those loyal to <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin" title="Salazar Slytherin">Salazar Slytherin</a>, he caused the hat to burst into flames.

</p><p>This distracted Voldemort and his Death Eaters, and Neville was able to pull off the <a href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a>, and from its depths he received the Sword of Godric Gryffindor and sliced off <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a>'s head in one swift, fluid motion.

Using his Invisibility Cloak, Harry protected the defenders of Hogwarts from attack. Soon, only Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange were the only two remaining and fighting, Voldemort duelling McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley at once, and Bellatrix duelling Hermione, Luna, and Ginny. Harry was torn between the two until he saw a Killing Curse shot beside Ginny's ear, the latter missing death by an inch.
</p><p>Harry redirected his path to Bellatrix, until being roughly knocked aside by Molly Weasley, who duelled and ultimately killed Bellatrix. Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb and Harry turned in to see McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley blasted backwards in pain and Voldemort directing his wand at Molly. Harry then cast a <a href="/wiki/Shield_Charm" title="Shield Charm">shield charm</a> to protect her from Voldemort's wrath, revealing himself for the final duel.

<p>Harry was a near-spitting image of his <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">father</a>, having untidy jet-black hair, but his startlingly green, almond-shaped eyes were identical to those of his <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">mother</a>. Harry's physique as a boy was described as "small and skinny", with a thin face and knobbly knees, due to his poor quality of life in his childhood. However, despite the neglect he suffered, Harry seems to have grown at the same rate as James, as when he was fifteen he was within an inch of James at the same age, and when he was seventeen he was exactly the same height his father was, and James was often described as tall. Harry wore round-rimmed <a href="/wiki/Glasses" title="Glasses">glasses</a>, peculiarly similar to his father's glasses. During his time hunting Voldemort's horcruxes, Harry's black hair grew shoulder length as was described when he saw his reflection in Malfoy Manor. This was due to his preoccupation with the hunt for the horcruxes.

<p>Upon Harry's forehead, covered by his unruly black hair, was a <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_scars" title="Harry Potter&#39;s scars">scar</a> shaped like a lightning bolt. The scar was a result of the failed (and famed) <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a> cast on him by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> when he was an infant. It burned painfully whenever Voldemort was near Harry or feeling particularly strong emotions, but this stopped after Voldemort's death and was reduced into an ordinary scar.
</p><p>Harry also had a faint scar on the back of his right hand which said, <i>"I must not tell lies".</i> This scar was caused while Harry spent detentions with <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>, who forced him to use the blood quill that carved the words into the back of his hand.
</p><p>In addition, Harry has an oval-shaped scar over his heart where the locket-Horcrux seared his skin during the confrontation with Nagini in Bathilda Bagshot's house, Godric's Hollow.

<p>Harry Potter was an extremely brave, loyal, and selfless person who possessed tremendous strength of character. He willingly went to what he truly believed to be his death because he believed that this was the only way to defeat the Dark Lord. Harry was also marked by what <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort" class="mw-redirect">Lord Voldemort</a> once deemed a "<i>weakness for heroics</i>" — he would go to great lengths and take great risks in order to help others, particularly his loved ones. Notably, this was taken advantage of by Voldemort in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>, when he lured Harry to the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a> by making him believe that his <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">godfather</a> was in danger.<sup id="cite_ref-OotP32_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OotP32-24">[25]</a></sup> Harry was also very strong-willed and unafraid to stand up for himself.

<p>Harry was perfectly prepared to put his friends' needs and best interests first, shown by how he ended his relationship with <a href="/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" title="Ginny Weasley" class="mw-redirect">Ginny Weasley</a> due to his concern for her well being, even though being with her was one of the best thing that ever happened to him.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP30_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP30-27">[28]</a></sup> The amount of trust that Harry put into his friends was so strong that he absolutely refused to consider that any of them would betray him to Voldemort. Considering that Harry knew <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">a person</a> who had betrayed all of his closest friends to Voldemort, they being Harry's parents, godfather and <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> who was there when Harry declared his trust in him, proves Harry's ability to <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a> so unequivocally.

<p>However, Harry was also accused of being arrogant, in particular by <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> (although in fairness, Snape was extremely biased, and Harry often found being famous and admired very difficult), and could be hot-tempered and impulsive.

In contrast, Dumbledore stated that "<i>many teachers report that he's modest, likable, and reasonably talented</i>".<sup id="cite_ref-DH_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-29">[30]</a></sup> Harry was prone to moodiness during his adolescence, though this is likely the result of the great emotional stress and trials he endured during this period.
</p><p>Harry possessed an instinctual, intuitive intelligence that allowed him to make intellectual leaps as opposed to the logical intelligence of Hermione.

This could be a result of the lack of confidence that Harry developed from growing up with the Dursleys.

<p>Harry's greatest strength was his ability to feel <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a>, despite having a miserable childhood of neglect. Harry was extremely loyal to and protective of his loved ones, and that love was what allowed him to overcome Voldemort, Dumbledore noting Harry's strength of will at resisting the temptation to act like Voldemort even when granted a direct insight into Voldemort's mind and methods. Harry even claimed that he felt sorry for Voldemort because of his inability to feel or understand love.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP23_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP23-32">[33]</a></sup>
</p><p>Albus Dumbledore noted that Harry was unfailingly kind, and he was also compassionate and respectful. This is shown by how he freed Dobby from the Malfoys, and by standing up for Muggle-borns, half-bloods, and Half-breeds, like Hagrid. This is likely attributable to his childhood, during which the Dursleys deprived him of compassion, and discriminated against him due to his <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magical</a> abilities. Also, Harry was not a cruel person and he never wished anyone harm. He rarely initiated duels, instead fighting in self-defence. Even after <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a> had murdered <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">his godfather</a>, Harry failed to cast the Crutiatus curse on her; Bellatrix noted the he had failed to cast the curse properly because he had cast it out of righteous anger and not malicious intent.<sup id="cite_ref-OotP36_28-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OotP36-28">[29]</a></sup> However, he did use the Cruciatus Curse more effectively on <a href="/wiki/Amycus" title="Amycus" class="mw-redirect">Amycus Carrow</a> after he spat at and insulted <a href="/wiki/Minerva" title="Minerva">Minerva McGonagall</a>.

<p>In some ways, Harry can become extremely intimidating toward people such as Gilderoy Lockhart, Mundungus Fletcher, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. It is seen that Harry can become extremely frightening when pushed to the point of anger or extreme annoyance. When in a bad mood and argumentative even Harry's closest friends have been shown to be wary of him, usually replying to his angry tone in a calm and appeasing voice. The only person who does not appear to be afraid of him when he is angry (other than his teachers and other authority figures in his life) is Ginny Weasley.
</p><p>Harry seems to have good and long memory, as he remember the motorbike ride to Privet Drive with Hagrid when he was eleven and could remember the deaths of his mother and Voldemort's laughter when the events occurred ten years earlier.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-33">[34]</a></sup> Harry also cared very much for his children. He comforted his daughter, <a href="/wiki/Lily_Potter" title="Lily Potter">Lily Potter</a> when she was upset about not going to <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>. He also made sure his younger son <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">Albus Potter</a> would not be teased a lot by Harry's older son, <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_II" title="James Potter II">James Potter II</a>.

<p>Although he never sought power himself, and would be content with a normal life, when the situation required him to step up, such as when he, Ron and Hermione discovered Voldemort and Quirrell's attempt to steal the Philosopher's Stone, or his time as teacher/leader of Dumbledore's Army, Harry has shown not-inconsiderable leadership abilities, to the point that Dumbledore reflected that Harry was a better leader than him as he never sought power for himself but simply had to assume the mantle of leadership due to circumstances beyond his control and found in the process that he did it well.
</p><p>During his youth, Harry also tended to see morality in a rather stark, absolute manner, particularly when it came to the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Houses" title="Hogwarts Houses">Houses</a>. Harry generally regarded members of <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> House as evil and therefore his enemies, while <a href="/wiki/Gryffindors" title="Gryffindors" class="mw-redirect">Gryffindors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a> were allies. The former part could be due to his own status as a Gryffindor, and that many of the Slytherins he encountered, such as <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, were significant enemies of his during this period. In addition, many of his friends and allies, such as Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, and Hagrid, were fellow Gryffindors. However, this mentality eroded as he aged, since he encountered both allies among Slytherin, such as <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a> (and, later, Snape), and enemies among the other three Houses, such as <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a> (a fellow Gryffindor) and <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a> (a Ravenclaw). By <a href="/wiki/2017" title="2017">2017</a>, Harry adopted a more moderate attitude on the Houses, telling his younger son <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">Albus Potter</a> that "<i>it doesn't matter to <a href="/wiki/Potter_family" title="Potter family">us</a></i>" if Albus was sorted in Slytherin or Gryffindor. In addition, Harry named that same son after <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, whom he recounted as "<i>the bravest man [he] ever knew</i>".

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">Love</a></b>: Harry's greatest power of all was his ability to love. In spite of being raised by a family that treated him with anything but affection, Harry remarkably turned out capable of very strong love.

His love for his friends also caused him to feel no concern for his own well being or happiness when they were at risk, and put himself in danger many times to protect them. This loving sacrifice conferred a certain amount of <a href="/wiki/Sacrificial_protection" title="Sacrificial protection">protection</a> onto his allies, making it so that spells Voldemort tried to place on them quickly wore off.<sup id="cite_ref-DH36_37-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH36-37">[38]</a></sup> Harry's ability to love has also protected and helped him on several occasions, such as when he defeated <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirrell</a> by causing his skin to burn (due to the magical protection from his mother's sacrifice<sup id="cite_ref-PS17_38-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS17-38">[39]</a></sup>), produced a <a href="/wiki/Patronus" title="Patronus" class="mw-redirect">Patronus</a> that could drive numerous <a href="/wiki/Dementors" title="Dementors" class="mw-redirect">Dementors</a> away,<sup id="cite_ref-PoA21_39-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PoA21-39">[40]</a></sup> repelled Voldemort himself when he possessed him,<sup id="cite_ref-OoP36_40-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OoP36-40">[41]</a></sup> and allowed him to close the connection between him and Voldemort when he was unable to perform <a href="/wiki/Occlumency" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-DH24_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH24-41">[42]</a></sup> His love was strongest when directed at <a href="/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" title="Ginny Weasley" class="mw-redirect">Ginny Weasley</a>, who was the driving force that kept him going until Voldemort was defeated.

After that soul fragment was destroyed, Harry lost this ability, which he was glad for.
</li><li><b>Insight into Voldemort's mind</b>: Also due to the piece of Voldemort's soul, Harry was able to look into Voldemort's mind and see through his senses from time to time. He sometimes used this ability to monitor what <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> was doing. However, it was a dangerous ability to have as well; Voldemort once used it, along with <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimency</a>, to plant a false vision in Harry's mind of <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> being tortured, which he used to lure Harry to the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-OotP23_53-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OotP23-53">[54]</a></sup> Additionally, because of their connection, Harry felt a burning pain in his scar whenever he and Voldemort were in close proximity or whenever Voldemort felt strong negative emotions.

<ul><li><b>Leadership skills</b>: While Harry never deliberately set out to be a leader to others, he had often taken charge when the situation required it, beginning with his impulsive decision to find and warn Hermione about the presence of a <a href="/wiki/Troll" title="Troll">troll</a> in the school during the 1991 <a href="/wiki/Hallowe%27en_feast" title="Hallowe&#39;en feast" class="mw-redirect">Hallowe'en feast</a> and progressing to the point where over thirty students, some of them in their sixth and seventh years — respect him as a teacher in <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army </a> despite his being younger than they were.<sup id="cite_ref-OotP18_75-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OotP18-75">[76]</a></sup> Dumbledore later noted that Harry was a superior leader to him as Dumbledore had deliberately sought power in his youth and subsequently avoided anything more demanding than his role as Hogwarts headmaster — while Harry had leadership thrust upon him and accepted the burden, acknowledging his responsibilities towards those who "followed" him regardless of how uncomfortable he might feel about the prospect and coordinating his efforts against his enemies well, when left with no other option but to take control.<sup id="cite_ref-DH35_76-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH35-76">[77]</a></sup>
</li><li><b>Indomitable will</b>: Harry appears to possess an unbreakable spirit and, though not above depression, he has never truly given up on any mission. He's been shown to rise from defeat and loss, such as the deaths of many loved ones, even stronger than before. His indomitable will is exemplified by his ability to resist the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a>, and also by the fact that he had never begged for mercy even in life-and-death situations, but fought back in defiance, as well as perform <a href="/wiki/Nonverbal_spell" title="Nonverbal spell">non-verbal spells</a> flawlessly.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_29-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-29">[30]</a></sup> His inability to perform <a href="/wiki/Occlumency" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a>, despite possessing the required willpower, is due to his inability to keep his emotions under control at times, and only once, during his lessons with Snape, did he managed to slightly escape <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimency</a>, but faltered again in the subsequent attempt.

<ul><li><b>Black Family Inheritance</b>: Harry also inherited the remainder of Sirius' wealth in wizard's gold at Gringotts. Since Sirius was disowned at the age of sixteen, it is likely that this wealth was limited to the gold left to him by his uncle <a href="/wiki/Alphard_Black" title="Alphard Black">Alphard Black</a>. However, that is open to debate because although Sirius Black was disinherited by his family, he ended up inheriting the <a href="/wiki/12_Grimmauld_Place" title="12 Grimmauld Place">12 Grimmauld Place</a> after their death, which might lead us to believe in the existence of forms of inheritance from his family other than what his uncle left him.

<a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">Lily Potter</a> died when their son was only a year old.

<p>The few times he ever saw his parents were through pictures given to him by <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a>, a vision within the <a href="/wiki/Mirror_of_Erised" title="Mirror of Erised">Mirror of Erised</a>, spectral forms which came out of Voldemort's wand during <i><a href="/wiki/Priori_Incantatem" title="Priori Incantatem">Priori Incantatem</a></i>, stored memories within the Pensieve, and as lifeless corpses in a flashback that was triggered when he saw his now-ruined parents' house.

Both James' and Lily's spirits had "<i>loving smiles on their faces</i>" and told their son that they were tremendously proud of him, for being so brave and strong despite all the suffering and pain that he had been forced to endure, and gave him the support he needed to sacrifice himself to Voldemort. Harry described their presence as his courage, the very reason why he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other, with his mother smiling at him, and his father nodding encouragement.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> maintained that Harry's greatest strength was his love for his parents and the love they had for him, and in part, this literally translated to the protection afforded to Harry by his mother's <a href="/wiki/Sacrificial_protection" title="Sacrificial protection">sacrifice</a>. Harry eventually named two of his children after his parents, a gesture that clearly stated that he would always keep the memory of his parents alive and honoured. It is seen that both his parents call him a name of affection, as James calls Harry "<i>son</i>" and Lily calls him "<i>sweetheart</i>", it is very possible that they had a nickname for Harry when he was a baby.

<p>After <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">Lily</a> and <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a> were murdered by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, Harry was taken in by his maternal aunt, <a href="/wiki/Petunia_Dursley" title="Petunia Dursley">Petunia Dursley</a>. Petunia had not been fond of her late sister, jealously and bitterly regarding her as a "freak" for her <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magical</a> abilities. She took out her resentment on Harry, treating him poorly and depriving him of affection. When Harry was finally told about his wizarding background, Petunia admitted she had always feared he would turn out "like his parents". Though after years of neglect, Harry did not particularly care for his aunt either, he was concerned enough for the <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">Dursleys</a> to push them to go into hiding during the height of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding War</a>. Just before departing, Petunia gave her nephew an odd, tremulous look, and seemed to want to say something more to him than goodbye, but ultimately just shook her head and left. She had wanted to wish him luck, and admit that her loathing of him and his world was born out of jealousy, but years of pretending that "normal" was best had hardened her too much.<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[80]</a></sup>
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, Harry was browsing through the repressed memories of <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> that were given to him after the latter's death at the fangs of <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a> and explained Snape's <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">true</a> <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">loyalties</a>. In addition, Harry viewed many memories of Petunia as a child, and discovered the real reasons for her deplorable treatment of him: Petunia, as a child, was jealous of <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">her sister</a> for her <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magical</a> abilities, and had written to <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> to accept her into Hogwarts so that she could learn magic herself. When this request was denied, Petunia responded by furiously rejecting the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a> in general and <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">her sister</a> in particular. However, Harry was more concerned with uncovering Snape's loyalties at the time. It is unknown if he ever revealed this information to anyone after the War.

<p>Harry and his cousin <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley</a> did not get along very well for most of their early lives. While <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Vernon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Petunia_Dursley" title="Petunia Dursley">Petunia</a> treated Harry poorly, they spoiled Dudley to the extreme.

He also expressed remorse for his prior treatment of Harry, and the two shook hands before the Dursleys left.
</p><p>The cousins eventually reconciled as adults, remaining on "Christmas card terms" and visiting each other occasionally.

Vernon seemed to resent this fact as much as, if not more than, his wife; he and Petunia begrudged Harry all but the meanest comforts, even forcing their nephew to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs until shortly before Harry's eleventh birthday. After Harry discovered his magical abilities, Vernon tended to take offense whenever Harry used words related or pertaining to magic in the <a href="/wiki/Number_4,_Privet_Drive" title="Number 4, Privet Drive" class="mw-redirect">house</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a> became Harry's best friend during their first year at Hogwarts. Ron, along with his <a href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">mother</a>, brothers, and <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">sister</a> first met Harry at <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Cross_Station" title="King&#39;s Cross Station">King's Cross Station</a>, when Harry was unable to find '<a href="/wiki/Platform_Nine_and_Three-Quarters" title="Platform Nine and Three-Quarters">Platform 9¾</a>.' Ron sat across from Harry during the train ride and the two almost immediately bonded over the ample <a href="/wiki/Popular_confectionery" title="Popular confectionery">sweets</a> Harry purchased from the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" title="Hogwarts Express">Hogwarts Express</a> <a href="/wiki/Honeydukes_Express" title="Honeydukes Express">food trolley</a>, which Harry happily shared with Ron, who was unable to afford any sweets himself. Harry cemented his friendship with Ron by turning down <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>'s offer to help Harry avoid making friends "<i>with the wrong sort</i>", after Draco insulted Ron's family. After being sorted into <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> House together and sharing the same dormitory, the two grew even closer, and eventually gained another best friend in <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> when they saved her from a <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell%27s_first_mountain_troll" title="Quirinus Quirrell&#39;s first mountain troll">troll</a> on Hallowe'en. As Ron was raised in a <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding</a> family, he was often called upon to explain customs and items that were commonplace to wizards, but completely new to Harry and Hermione, who had both been raised in <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">Muggle</a> society.
</p><p>In the summer of <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, after <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a> had prevented Harry from receiving any letters, Ron and his twin brothers (<a href="/wiki/Fred_and_George_Weasley" title="Fred and George Weasley">Fred and George</a>) flew their <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">father</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Flying_Ford_Anglia" title="Flying Ford Anglia">Flying Ford Anglia</a> to rescue Harry from Privet Drive. After spending a few days less than a month at <a href="/wiki/The_Burrow" title="The Burrow">Ron's home</a>, Harry and Ron were supposed to return to school on the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" title="Hogwarts Express">Hogwarts Express</a> with Ron's other siblings. However, Dobby had blocked the entrance to the platform, and Harry and Ron were unable to board the train. Panicking, the pair flew the enchanted car to Hogwarts; however, they landed on the <a href="/wiki/Whomping_Willow" title="Whomping Willow">Whomping Willow</a> and lost the car as well as broke Ron's wand. Later on in the year, when Hermione had been <a href="/wiki/Petrification" title="Petrification">Petrified</a> by <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_basilisk" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s basilisk" class="mw-redirect">Salazar Slytherin's basilisk</a>, Harry and Ron ventured into the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a> together, where they were rescued from a <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest_Acromantula_colony" title="Forbidden Forest Acromantula colony">clan</a> of <a href="/wiki/Acromantula" title="Acromantula">Acromantula</a> by the missing Ford Anglia.

<p>Harry and Ron had an even more serious falling out in <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, when they, along with Hermione, were hunting Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>; the negative energy within <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_Locket" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s Locket" class="mw-redirect">Salazar Slytherin's Locket</a> affected Ron more severely than the other two, causing him to temporarily abandon his friends before regretting his decision, and returning to them as soon as he was able. During this outbreak, Ron thought that Harry and Hermione were in love, which momentarily disrupted Ron and Hermione's relationship.
</p><p>Upon his return, Ron watched Harry follow the <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">silver doe</a> to <a href="/wiki/Godric_Gryffindor%27s_sword" title="Godric Gryffindor&#39;s sword" class="mw-redirect">Godric Gryffindor's sword</a>, and saved Harry's life after he jumped into a lake to retrieve it. When Harry finally <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">opened</a> the locket, Ron saw the part of Voldemort's soul transform into a supposed Harry and Hermione kissing, and it almost led him to believe that the imagined relationship between Harry and Hermione was real. However, Lord Voldemort underestimated how strong Ron really was, and so the locket was destroyed when Ron plunged the sword of Griffyndor into it and overcame his fears and worries.
</p><p>The hardships Ron and Harry faced together served to reinforce their bond, and they remained friends for life. Ron's fierce loyalty and sense of humour often helped Harry relax and have fun even in the darkest times of his life. The two were like brothers, and would eventually become brothers-in-law when Harry married Ginny. Ron was the uncle of Harry's three children, and became godfather to Harry and Ginny's eldest son, <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_II" title="James Potter II">James Sirius Potter</a>.

<p>Though Harry and Ron initially found <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> stuck-up and arrogant, the three became best friends after Harry and Ron saved her from a troll in <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a>, and she, in turn, lied to keep them from getting in trouble.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_33-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-33">[34]</a></sup> Her quick mind was at times the only thing that saved the three friends from potential failure in both life-threatening and every-day situations. Out of concern for her friend, Hermione often chided Harry for his recklessness; though this occasionally put some strain on their relationship, it often served to keep Harry on track, such as when he briefly considered pursuing the <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a> instead of the <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>.
</p><p>Hermione was always with Harry and was fiercely protective of him, from snapping at <a href="/wiki/Lavender_Brown" title="Lavender Brown">Lavender Brown</a> when she doubted Harry's claim that <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> returned to interceding when <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> was about to use the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> on Harry. Hermione stood by Harry even when <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a> doubted him during the Triwizard Tournament, accepting his story "without question", and when Ron temporarily left them in <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, despite her own romantic feelings for Ron.

<p>Though their friendship remained entirely platonic, at times their closeness engendered jealously or curiosity in others; especially those who had feelings for one or the other, including Cho Chang, Viktor Krum, and even Ron. When the two were briefly alone together during the search for the <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>, Harry and Hermione experienced some "<i>charged moments,</i>" in which the two "<i>shared something very intense</i>";<sup id="cite_ref-HAH_81-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HAH-81">[82]</a></sup> however, each remained devoted to <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny</a> and Ron, respectively.
</p><p>As Harry himself described, Hermione was one of two of his best friends, akin to a sister. It could be further said she was like his older sister, protective and always trying to keep him in line. The two were also close enough to share their feelings with one another before sharing those feelings with their significant other. Through Hermione's marriage to <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, and through Harry's marriage to Ginny, Hermione became his sister-in-law, as well as the aunt and godmother of his children.

Though the feeling moderated over time, until <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a> she was too shy and nervous around him to speak to him comfortably. She became even further embarrassed after Harry saved her from the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> in his second year, when she had been possessed by a fragment of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>'s <a href="/wiki/T._M._Riddle%27s_Diary" title="T.

Ginny took this advice, and Harry came to see her as she truly was: strong-willed, funny, stubborn, and compassionate.
</p><p>The two became good friends in Harry's <a href="/wiki/1995%E2%80%931996_school_year" title="1995–1996 school year">fifth year</a>, the same year Harry started to enjoy her company as much as Ron or Hermione's, and also able to tell him to shut up and cheer up during his depression.

<p>After his relationship with <a href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a> "fell apart" and Harry spent a good deal of time with <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> at <a href="/wiki/The_Burrow" title="The Burrow">The Burrow</a> in the summer of <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>, Harry's feelings for Ginny began to deepen and change. In his first potions class with <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Slughorn</a>, the love potion <a href="/wiki/Amortentia" title="Amortentia">Amortentia</a> revealed he was attracted to "<i>something flowery he had smelled at the Burrow</i>", which later turned out to be Ginny's hair. After witnessing her kissing <a href="/wiki/Dean_Thomas" title="Dean Thomas">Dean Thomas</a>, Harry started to feel jealous and fantasise about kissing her himself, although he determinedly tried to convince himself that his feelings for her were "elder-brotherly". He began having dreams about her of a seemingly intimate nature, even reflecting once that he was very glad that Ron could not perform <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimency</a>. One of the many reasons that Harry fell in love with Ginny is that she is rarely weepy, in stark contrast to Cho, who cried all over the place after her previous boyfriend was killed.
</p><p>Shortly after Ginny and Dean broke up, she and Harry spontaneously kissed at a Gryffindor <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_Cup" title="Quidditch Cup" class="mw-redirect">Quidditch Cup</a> victory party.

However, after the murder of <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, Harry decided to end things with Ginny, fearing that <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> would target her if he learned of their blossoming/growing strong romance and knowing that he would be leaving with Ron and Hermione to find Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>. Ginny was upset, but respected Harry's decision, knowing that it was for "<i>some stupid, noble reason.</i>"

<p>The two soon saw each other again during the summer while Harry stayed at the Burrow. For Harry's seventeenth <a href="/wiki/31_July" title="31 July">birthday</a>, Ginny passionately kissed Harry as something for him to remember her by, but they were interrupted by Ron and Hermione. The former told Harry not to "<i>mess Ginny around</i>", as his sister had been "<i>pretty cut up</i>" when Harry ended their romantic relationship, though Hermione was more sympathetic towards the two of them. The two were soon separated for months as Harry tracked down <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a> with Hermione and Ron, while Ginny returned to <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, but still harboured pretty strong romantic feelings for one another.

<p>Beginning in the summer of <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, Harry came to spend many of his holidays with the <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasley family</a>, at <a href="/wiki/The_Burrow" title="The Burrow">the Burrow</a>. Through his friendship with <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>, and his later romance with <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny</a>, the Weasleys became far more of a family to him than the <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">Dursleys</a> ever were.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">Molly Weasley</a> announced to Harry's <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">godfather</a> that Harry was "as good as" one of her actual sons, and her <a href="/wiki/Boggart" title="Boggart">Boggart</a> — of dead family members, one after another — included Harry. She was always keen to make sure Harry was taken care of; at one point Harry noted that she "<i>fussed over the state of his socks and tried to get him to eat fourth helpings at every meal</i>". Her caring sometimes led her to become overprotective of Harry, such as when she strongly objected to the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order</a> members giving Harry information regarding <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> during the summer of <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>. She even went as far as to give him, for his coming of age, her <a href="/wiki/Fabian_Prewett" title="Fabian Prewett">brother</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Fabian_Prewett%27s_watch" title="Fabian Prewett&#39;s watch">watch</a>, a clearly treasured family heirloom, and reminder of how much she had already lost in the struggle against Voldemort.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> was a surrogate father to Harry who like his wife treated him like one of his own children by opening his home to him for months at a time and inviting him to family functions. He unlike most entrusted Harry with sensitive information others had felt him too young to understand. Harry once saved Mr Weasley's life, after <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Arthur_Weasley" title="Attack on Arthur Weasley">seeing</a> him being attacked by <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a> before Christmas of <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>.
</p><p>When Ron was poisoned in Harry's sixth year, and Harry saved him with a <a href="/wiki/Bezoar" title="Bezoar">bezoar</a>, Arthur pointed out how he had saved several members of the Weasley family, and said that it was a good day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit with him on the train in 1991.

Fred's death during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> was one of the deaths that hit Harry the hardest.
</p><p>Harry liked Percy Weasley the least of Ron's brothers, finding him pompous, although he was genuinely shocked when Percy sided with the Ministry against him in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>. Percy later came to his senses and fought alongside Harry in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>. When Harry saw his sons go to Hogwarts, he thought he overheard Percy talking and "<i>was glad to have the excuse not to stop and say hello</i>".

<p>Harry had three children with <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>: <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_II" title="James Potter II">James Sirius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">Albus Severus</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lily_Potter" title="Lily Potter">Lily&#160;Luna Potter</a>. The eldest, James, has an outgoing personality and was a troublemaker, much like his <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">grandfather and namesake</a>, and liked to tease his brother Albus. Albus, on the other hand, was quieter and more thoughtful, much like his father. 
</p><p>When he admitted to Harry that he was afraid of being sorted into <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a>, Harry told him that Albus and Severus were the names of two former headmasters of Hogwarts; one was a Slytherin, and "<i><a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">the bravest man I ever knew</a></i>". He also informed his son that the Sorting Hat would listen to the wearer's choice, and he knew that for a fact because it had considered putting him into Slytherin; this was something Harry had not shared with any of his other children. Albus also closely resembled Harry, having the same eyes, untidy hair, and glasses. Lily, the youngest, was very like her mother. Harry and Lily were seen holding hands while walking into Kings Cross, much like <a href="/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" title="Ginny Weasley" class="mw-redirect">Lily's mother</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">maternal grandfather</a>. Lily was jealous of her brothers as they boarded the train for Hogwarts, exactly as Ginny had been in <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a>. Harry comforted her by reminding her that she would be joining them in two years.
</p><p>It is seen through Harry's actions that he loves and cherishes each of his children very much.

<p>Harry had many nieces and nephews through the <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasley family</a>. The children of <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur</a> were <a href="/wiki/Victoire_Weasley" title="Victoire Weasley">Victoire</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dominique_Weasley" title="Dominique Weasley">Dominique</a> and <a href="/wiki/Louis_Weasley" title="Louis Weasley">Louis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_II" title="James Potter II">James</a> announced that he had seen <a href="/wiki/Edward_Lupin" title="Edward Lupin">Teddy Lupin</a> kissing Victoire at <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Cross_Station" title="King&#39;s Cross Station">King's Cross Station</a>, in <a href="/wiki/2017" title="2017">2017</a>. The children of <a href="/wiki/Percy_Weasley" title="Percy Weasley">Percy</a> and his wife, <a href="/wiki/Audrey_Weasley" title="Audrey Weasley">Audrey</a>, were <a href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley_II" title="Molly Weasley II">Molly</a>, who was named after her <a href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">grandmother</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Weasley" title="Lucy Weasley">Lucy</a>, and either Molly or both of the girls were attending Hogwarts in the 2017-2018 school year, because Percy was at King's Cross on 1 September 2017. The children of <a href="/wiki/George_Weasley" title="George Weasley">George</a> and <a href="/wiki/Angelina_Johnson" title="Angelina Johnson">Angelina Johnson</a> were <a href="/wiki/Fred_Weasley_II" title="Fred Weasley II">Fred</a>, who was named after his late <a href="/wiki/Fred_Weasley" title="Fred Weasley">uncle</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Roxanne_Weasley" title="Roxanne Weasley">Roxanne</a>.
</p><p>Harry was most likely closest to Ron and Hermione's children, <a href="/wiki/Rose_Weasley" title="Rose Weasley">Rose</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Weasley" title="Hugo Weasley">Hugo</a>, as they were the same ages as <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">Albus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lily_Potter" title="Lily Potter">Lily</a>, respectively, and Albus was "relieved" to meet up with Rose at King's Cross. Ron and Hermione were probably close to all of Harry's children as well, and Harry's eldest son, <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_II" title="James Potter II">James</a> is their godson. It is also highly likely that Ron and Hermione made Harry <a href="/wiki/Rose_Weasley" title="Rose Weasley">their daughter's</a> godfather.

<p>Harry's first opinion of <a href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur Delacour</a> in <a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a> was that she was a very beautiful girl who looked like a <a href="/wiki/Veela" title="Veela">Veela</a>.

</p><p>Fleur met Harry again at the Burrow, in 1996, when Fleur was about to marry <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill Weasley</a>, the eldest brother of Harry's best friend, Ron. After the <a href="/wiki/Skirmish_at_Malfoy_Manor" title="Skirmish at Malfoy Manor">Skirmish at Malfoy Manor</a>, Harry and his friends lived with Bill and Fleur for roughly one month at <a href="/wiki/Shell_Cottage" title="Shell Cottage">Shell Cottage</a>, where Fleur cared for them all, much like a mother or an older sister.

<p><a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> was a mentor to Harry, akin to a grandfather figure. Dumbledore arranged for Harry to be rescued from <a href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Godric&#39;s Hollow">Godric's Hollow</a> after his parents' murder and left him in the care of his aunt <a href="/wiki/Petunia_Dursley" title="Petunia Dursley">Petunia Dursley</a> in order to give him the benefit of the magical protection of his mother's blood. In Harry's <a href="/wiki/1995-1996_school_year" title="1995-1996 school year" class="mw-redirect">fifth year</a>, he admitted to Harry that he had not told him of the <a href="/wiki/Prophecy" title="Prophecy">prophecy</a> concerning himself and <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a>, because he wanted to spare Harry the pain and responsibility it would burden him with for as long as possible. Though Harry was initially furious with him for the frustration he felt for being kept in the dark, the two continued to be close. By Harry's <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">sixth year</a>, Dumbledore took on the role of providing Harry with additional insights into the origins of Lord Voldemort, largely through the use of the <a href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a>. He entrusted Harry with the task of getting a final, crucial <a href="/wiki/Memory" title="Memory">memory</a> from <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a> regarding Voldemort's knowledge of <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>.
</p><p>Dumbledore's death was greatly devastating to Harry, though he persevered in the impossibly difficult task Dumbledore had left him of finding and destroying each of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Harry had difficulty coping with the fact that there was much Dumbledore had not told him about his history with the <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a>; however, when he learned during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> that Dumbledore had supposedly planned all along for Harry to sacrifice himself, Harry innately showed incredible faith in his mentor by serenely accepting the task. When Harry allowed himself to be struck by Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a>, his soul entered a state of <a href="/wiki/Limbo" title="Limbo">Limbo</a>, resembling <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Cross_Station" title="King&#39;s Cross Station">King's Cross Station</a>, where Dumbledore was waiting to speak with him.

<p>The fact that Dumbledore himself was there to meet Harry in a place between life and death attested to the bond of fellowship between them. They discussed all that had happened to Harry since Dumbledore's death, as well as things that had remained unsaid prior to it. At one point, Dumbledore seemed to beg for Harry's reassurance, uncharacteristically doubting some of the decisions he had made in the course of his life, which Harry easily gave him. Though Harry had felt some resentment for how little he felt Dumbledore had actually revealed of himself in their time together, Harry probably learned secrets and saw a side of Dumbledore that no one else knew during the events at "King's Cross".
</p><p>Harry also had a unique relationship with the Dumbledore's phoenix, <a href="/wiki/Fawkes" title="Fawkes">Fawkes</a>; not only was Harry's <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_wand" title="Harry Potter&#39;s wand">wand</a> one of the only two ever made with feathers from Fawkes's tail, but the phoenix found Harry in the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>, helped him kill <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_Basilisk" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s Basilisk" class="mw-redirect">Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk</a>, and provided Harry with the only known antidote to <a href="/wiki/Basilisk_venom" title="Basilisk venom">Basilisk venom</a>: phoenix tears. Fawkes's song was a source of comfort for Harry on a number occasions before the phoenix left Hogwarts following Dumbledore's death.
</p><p>Harry later named his <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">second son</a> Albus, after the Hogwarts Headmaster.

<p><a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, who sought to destroy Harry ever since the boy was an infant, was Harry's most dangerous enemy. Dumbledore described the relationship between <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> and Harry as follows: "<i>You and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested... Voldemort wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history... both kin and mortal enemy</i>". The two wizards had their destines locked together even since <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney%27s_first_prophecy" title="Sybill Trelawney&#39;s first prophecy">a prophecy</a> foretelling of child "<i>with the power to Vanquish the Dark Lord</i>" was made and relayed in part Voldemort, who decided to act to prevent it from coming to fruition. Though two infants fit the description of "The Chosen One", Voldemort believed the son of <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lily_Potter" title="Lily Potter">Lily Potter</a> posed the greater threat, as he, like Voldemort himself, was a <a href="/wiki/Half-blood" title="Half-blood">half-blood</a>.
</p><p>To circumvent the prophecy, Voldemort went to <a href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Godric&#39;s Hollow">Godric's Hollow</a> to murder the baby Harry. When Lily refused to move aside and allow Voldemort access to his true target, her son, her willing sacrifice afforded Harry a <a href="/wiki/Sacrificial_protection" title="Sacrificial protection">protection</a> so powerful, it caused the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a> Voldemort aimed at Harry to rebound. Voldemort's body was destroyed and the fragment of soul residing within it was forced to flee and exist in a weak, spectral form. In attempting to kill Harry, Voldemort unintentionally embedded a piece of his <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">soul</a> and some of his own abilities into Harry, as well as effectively marking Harry "as his equal". It was only after Voldemort attacked Harry that the latter became a <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">Parselmouth</a>, a trait Voldemort inherited from <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin" title="Salazar Slytherin">Salazar Slytherin</a>, as well as was able to see into Voldemort's mind on occasion — both tools that aided Harry in bringing about Lord Voldemort's end. As it happened, when Voldemort tried to kill Harry in the Forbidden Forest during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, he was unable to because when Voldemort had used Harry's blood to restore his body, he had unwittingly bound Harry's life to his own. As such, the curse only destroyed the Horcrux piece of Voldemort’s soul within Harry, while Harry survived.

<p>There are many features that both Voldemort and Harry share: both were only children who were "abandoned" at a very young age, too young to properly remember their parents. Both had grown up believing untruths about their parents (Harry was told that his parents were unemployed drunks who had died in a car accident, while Voldemort was allegedly told that his mother was from a circus). Lord Voldemort, like Harry, never knew his mother. Although he did meet his father, he only sought him out for revenge to kill him. Harry only vaguely remembers both his parents, being too young when they were killed to remember anything more than vague images and fleeting feelings. However, he has been able to connect with them through objects once belonging to his father, such as the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map, his mother's letter, old photographs, and also his parents' friends. He also met their spirits via the <a href="/wiki/Resurrection_Stone" title="Resurrection Stone">Resurrection Stone</a>. In addition, both boys wore second-hand clothes: Harry was given his repulsive cousin Dudley's enormous cast offs and Tom wore tatty hand-me-downs supplied by the orphanage. Both Riddle and Harry were friendless as children: Harry was kept isolated and denied a normal social life by his <a href="/wiki/Petunia_Dursley" title="Petunia Dursley">aunt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">uncle</a>, while Tom expressed his bitterness and loneliness by tormenting the other orphans, frightening them away.

<p>Both Harry and Voldemort were Parselmouths: wizards who have the ability to speak to snakes. This is less coincidental than it might seem, for Voldemort actually transferred this ability to Harry when attacking him. Voldemort was in <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> house and the <a href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a> almost placed Harry into Slytherin, though Harry asked to be placed in some other House, thus, making it so his choices define who he is. Both boys had followers: Tom gathered <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle%27s_gang" title="Tom Riddle&#39;s gang">a small group of "<i>friends</i>"</a> through fear, intimidation, as well as tenuous promises and then later a whole group calling themselves the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>. Similarly, many students gravitated to Harry out of loyalty and a shared cause, but also curiosity and an attraction to his fame.

<p>The two wizards also had "twin" wands: each wand contained the same phoenix feather <a href="/wiki/Wand_core" title="Wand core">wand core</a>, that is later revealed to be from <a href="/wiki/Fawkes" title="Fawkes">Fawkes</a>, Dumbledore's pet phoenix. As well, both boys were unaware they were wizards until about the age of eleven, even though each could make unusual things happen. Both Harry and Tom were of great interest to Dumbledore and both felt their first home was Hogwarts. In addition, both achieved greatness in the <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> class, however, each for different reasons. Both Harry and Voldemort were half-bloods, though that only matters to Tom Riddle. Both are also rule breakers: Harry, of course, feels justified when he does things like leaving his dorm after hours, entering the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a>, as well as eavesdropping on teachers because he believes it serves a greater purpose. Tom might have engaged in similar activities, but if so, then he did this for darker and self-serving reasons, as well as without benefit of an Invisibility Cloak like Harry: while at school, Tom framed Hagrid for a girl's death, then went on to worse crimes.

<p>However, there are also many features that set Harry and Voldemort apart: at his initial Sorting, Harry requested he not be placed in Slytherin. It is unlikely Tom Riddle would have made a similar request, even if he was unaware what his ancestry was. Furthermore, Voldemort never had friends, only followers who feared him or hoped to gain some reward or advantage. Harry made many friends: his dorm-mates, the Weasley family, as well as many teachers: especially Hagrid, Remus Lupin, as well as (the real) Mad-Eye Moody. They supported Harry because they share a common belief. While both were half-blood, Harry's mother, a witch, was Muggle-born, whereas Lord Voldemort's <i>father</i> was a Muggle, as well as incidentally, so was Snape's, which is why he called himself the Half-Blood Prince.

<p>Most importantly, Harry cared about the people around him, even pitying Draco Malfoy when the boy was ordered by Voldemort to assassinate Dumbledore. Harry had the ability to love and be compassionate, making him more vulnerable to suffering pain, but also capable of experiencing deep friendship and loyalty that helped guide him to greatness. For Voldemort, love, fidelity, or compassion are unknown and unwelcome concepts. Voldemort would demand loyalty and respect from his <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>, but had little in return. Voldemort had a tendency to dispose of <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> who either failed him, angered him, or were no longer of use to him. Despite literally sharing the same blood, Voldemort and Harry were also related by blood, however distantly, through their shared descent from the Peverells (Voldemort through the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Gaunt" title="House of Gaunt">Gaunts</a> and Harry through the <a href="/wiki/Potter_family" title="Potter family">Potters</a>). This made them distant cousins.

If so, it is highly unlikely Harry will ever use the wand due to his personal history with both the wand itself and its original owner.
</p><p>Voldemort and Harry share some things: The same wand cores and the same family because Harry Potter is related to Tom Riddle, they are related through the <a href="/wiki/Peverell_family" title="Peverell family">Peverell brothers</a>.

<p>Filling in as a paternal figure or an uncle (unlike Uncle Vernon), <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> was Harry's godfather, as well as his most trusted confidant. When <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_scars" title="Harry Potter&#39;s scars">Harry's scar</a> hurt in <a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a>, he acknowledged that he could tell and ask Sirius anything without feeling foolish, hesitant, or uncomfortable. During <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>'s dictatorial rule over Hogwarts during the <a href="/wiki/1995%E2%80%931996_school_year" title="1995–1996 school year">1995–1996 school year</a>, Sirius supported Harry's rebellion against her, telling Harry that he and <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a> would have done the same thing. He also supported his <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">plan to teach students</a> practical defensive magic.
</p><p>When Harry first met Sirius, he wanted to kill Sirius for the betrayal of his parents.

</p><p>Harry, for his part, became very protective of Sirius. Knowing that the Ministry believed him guilty of mass murder, Harry refused to put Sirius in danger if it could be avoided.

<p>When Sirius was killed in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, Harry at first refused to believe he was dead. Harry was completely devastated by Sirius's death; for the following months, Harry avoided talking about Sirius if he could; whenever the subject came up, he would distract himself in some way to avoid joining the discussion. Very fortunately, Harry was able to move on with his life after a short period of grieving, knowing that Sirius would not want him to shut himself away or crack up. When Harry prepared to sacrifice himself to Voldemort in <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, Sirius was one of the spirits he summoned using the <a href="/wiki/Resurrection_Stone" title="Resurrection Stone">Resurrection Stone</a>. Sirius assured Harry that dying was "<i>quicker and easier</i>" than falling asleep.
</p><p>Sirius also was the one who gave Harry his first <a href="/wiki/Toy_broomstick" title="Toy broomstick">toy broomstick</a>, as a year old baby. In a letter to Sirius, Harry's mother thanked him and described James's impression that Harry would be a "<i>good Quidditch player.</i>" Sirius later gave Harry another <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broomstick</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Firebolt" title="Firebolt">Firebolt</a>, as thirteen years's worth of presents from his godfather.
</p><p>Harry would name his <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_II" title="James Potter II">eldest son</a> after James and Sirius.

<p>Harry's simple student-teacher relationship with <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> quickly developed into a strong friendship, akin to the one that a kind, loving uncle and his favourite nephew would share.
</p><p>Harry first met Remus when he was an infant, and again in <a href="/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a> when Remus saved him from the <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> on the Hogwarts Express. Remus had been appointed the <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> professor at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> that year, and soon became his favourite professor as well as a mentor of sorts. It was suggested that Remus' classes were how Harry discovered his extraordinary talent for <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a>. When Harry continued to be badly affected by <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a>, Remus agreed to give Harry <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_Remus_Lupin%27s_private_lessons" title="Harry Potter and Remus Lupin&#39;s private lessons" class="mw-redirect">private lessons</a> to teach him the <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus Charm</a>. It was during these lessons that Harry discovered that Remus was one of his parents' oldest, dearest friends. Although Remus attempted to maintain a teacher-student relationship with Harry, he did act more as a close friend or a beloved uncle at times, answering his questions patiently, sharing Butterbeer after a private lesson, assisting him in avoiding trouble with <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Professor Snape</a>, and even returning the <a href="/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map" title="Marauder&#39;s Map">Marauder's Map</a> to Harry once he was no longer a professor. Harry, in turn, became deeply fond of Remus, and was extremely upset to hear of his resignation after <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> exposed him as a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a>. He even attempted to try and talk him into staying on at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, but it was futile, though Remus told him that it had been a real pleasure teaching him, and assured him that they would meet again.
</p><p>The two indeed met again in the summer of <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a> when members of the <a href="/wiki/Advance_Guard" title="Advance Guard">Advance Guard</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> arrived to pick up Harry from Privet Drive. Although initially wary of intruders, Harry relaxed on learning of Remus' presence in the group, indicating that he still trusted his father's old dear friend despite a year without contact. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, Remus protected Harry and <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a> from an attack by <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> and saved Harry's life by preventing him from running into the <a href="/wiki/Veil" title="Veil">Veil</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Death_Chamber" title="Death Chamber">Death Chamber</a> in an attempt to save his godfather, <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>.

<p>Remus' undercover assignment with the <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolves</a> prevented him from maintaining contact with Harry in the wake of his <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">godfather</a>'s death, something about which he expressed regret. On the few occasions that they saw each other during Harry's sixth year, Harry was worried about Remus' increasingly haggard and gaunt appearance. He displayed a protective streak towards Remus, expressing anger over his forced resignation from <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> and the general perception of <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolves</a>.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, Harry was thrilled to hear of Remus' marriage to <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a> and was puzzled by Lupin's increasingly worried appearance. He was outraged when Remus temporarily left his <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">wife</a> for fear of their then unborn child becoming a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a>. While Harry maintained his stance on their argument, he deeply regretted the harsh words he said to Remus in his anger. When Remus' son <a href="/wiki/Edward_Lupin" title="Edward Lupin">Teddy Lupin</a> was born, Harry was relieved that Remus had clearly forgiven him, and was overwhelmed but delighted to be made Teddy's godfather. Remus also spoke about Harry on <a href="/wiki/Potterwatch" title="Potterwatch">Potterwatch</a>, saying that if Harry could hear him he would tell him to trust his instincts which were "<i>nearly always right</i>". This deeply affected Harry who was then informed by Ron that Lupin was back with Tonks, having apparently listened to what Harry had said despite the way he said it.
</p><p>Of all the people who died during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, Remus' death, along with those of his wife, <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fred_Weasley" title="Fred Weasley">Fred Weasley</a>, were the ones that hit Harry the hardest. Remus was one of the spirits that was summoned by the <a href="/wiki/Resurrection_Stone" title="Resurrection Stone">Resurrection Stone</a> to speak to Harry and give him the support he needed as he walked to what he believed was his death, indicating the almost familial bond between Remus and Harry.
</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></i>, Harry wrote in the werewolf section that they "<i>aren't all bad</i>", and Harry and <a href="/wiki/Edward_Lupin" title="Edward Lupin">Remus' son, Teddy</a> became very close after the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">war</a>. Harry and his family had dinner with Teddy four times a week and Harry's children hoped that Teddy would either be married into the Weasley-Potter family, or Harry would ask Teddy to move in with <a href="/wiki/Potter_family" title="Potter family">the Potters</a>.

In Harry's <a href="/wiki/1995-1996_school_year" title="1995-1996 school year" class="mw-redirect">fifth year</a>, McGonagall urged Harry not to give <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> or the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry</a> any more ammunition to use against him, and she later stood up for him to Umbridge, promising to help Harry become an Auror if it was the last thing she did. Harry felt a powerful surge of anger when Umbridge later gloated that Minerva was too ill to talk to anyone after being hit in the chest with four simultaneous <a href="/wiki/Stunning_Spell" title="Stunning Spell">Stunners</a>.
</p><p>McGonagall considered him a talented and likeable wizard<sup id="cite_ref-DH33_82-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH33-82">[83]</a></sup> and expressed pride at having Harry in her house, In turn Harry felt affection for her. He was so enranged at <a href="/wiki/Amycus_Carrow" title="Amycus Carrow">Amycus Carrow</a> for spitting in McGonagall's face, that he succeeded in using the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eater" title="Death Eater" class="mw-redirect">Death Eater</a>, agreeing with Bellatrix Lestrange's assertion that one had to "<i>really mean it</i>" in order to perform the curse effectively. McGonagall returned Harry's devotion by arming Hogwarts on Harry's request, and then fighting Voldemort head on in the final battle. When <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> had Harry's seemingly dead body brought out from the Forest, Minerva gave a terrible cry, to rival those of Ron, Hermione, and Ginny and later embraced him when he revealed himself to be alive and killed Voldemort.

<p>During his years in school, Harry's relationship with <a href="/wiki/Potions_master" title="Potions master" class="mw-redirect">Potions master</a> <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> was nothing short of deepest mutual loathing. When Harry first saw Snape in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Hall" title="Great Hall">Great Hall</a> at Hogwarts, he got the initial feeling that Snape disliked him; only after his first <a href="/wiki/Potions_(class)" title="Potions (class)">Potions</a> lesson did Harry realise the resentment dug much deeper. Harry soon learned that Snape saw Harry as a younger version of <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">his father</a> — a self-centred boy who enjoyed the attention paid to him, and was "<i>so arrogant that criticism simply bounced off him.</i>" 
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, after having "looked inside" <a href="/wiki/Voldemort" title="Voldemort" class="mw-redirect">Voldemort</a> 's mind, and discovering that <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a>, who was on guard duty at the<a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries"> Department of Mysteries</a> , was to be killed by <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a>, Voldemort's snake, <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore" title="Dumbledore" class="mw-redirect">Dumbledore</a> ordered Snape to teach Harry the skill of <a href="/wiki/Occlumency" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a>, to block his mind from Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimency</a> probing. A very tedious and trying set of lessons, at one point Snape provoked Harry into casting a shield charm, which allowed Harry to catch a glimpse of Snape's own memories. Later, when Snape left the room to attend to <a href="/wiki/Montague" title="Montague" class="mw-redirect">Montague</a>, Harry entered the <a href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">pensieve</a> in order to see what memories Snape was hiding from him — which turned out to be of Snape being taunted by <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter I</a> and the other Marauders, and of Snape calling Lily a mudblood out of humiliation. This caused Harry great distress because he had never before believed a word of Snape's criticisms of James. Although humbling Harry somewhat towards Snape, they still retained a very strained and bitter relationship during Harry's remaining time at Hogwarts.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a>, Snape's relationship with Harry was further strained when Harry helped <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> escape as Snape during that time believed that Sirius betrayed Harry's mother <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">Lily Potter I</a>, whom he loved since childhood, to Voldemort. Harry, on the other hand, had learned that Sirius was innocent, having been framed by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a> who was the actual culprit.

He believed that Snape's taunt to Sirius about his uselessness to the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> was one of the main factors which caused Sirius to leave his house and fight. Harry's hatred of Snape reached its height in <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a> when he discovered that Snape had told Voldemort about <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney%27s_first_prophecy" title="Sybill Trelawney&#39;s first prophecy">the Prophecy</a> involving him, which led Harry to believe that Snape had betrayed his parents. Harry raged at <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> for trusting Snape, only to have Dumbledore silence him. Later the same night, Snape <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Astronomy_Tower" title="Battle of the Astronomy Tower">killed</a> Dumbledore, which only seemed to confirm what Harry had come to believe about his former Potions master, resenting Snape almost as much as he resented Voldemort himself.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, Harry witnessed Voldemort order the death of Severus Snape, in an attempt to gain the allegiance of the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a>. Despite his hatred of his former teacher, he still felt sorry for the way Voldemort had killed Snape without even feeling sorry for taking his life. As Voldemort left Snape mortally wounded by <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Shrieking_Shack" title="Shrieking Shack">Shrieking Shack</a>, Harry was able to obtain several <a href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">memories</a> that contained not only the truth about Snape's motives and unwavering allegiance to the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>, but relayed a crucial message from Dumbledore. What Harry discovered about Snape's persistent love for Lily Evans also explained Snape's final act: he had instructed Harry to look at him, so he could die looking into the eyes Harry inherited from his mother.
</p><p>By <a href="/wiki/2017" title="2017">2017</a>, Harry considered Snape to be one of the bravest men he had ever known, and gave his <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">second son</a>, who was the only one of his children to inherit Lily's eyes, the middle name "Severus".<sup><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">[HP7]</a></sup> Harry ensured that Snape's portrait eventually found its rightful place among Hogwarts's previous headmasters.
</p><p>Ironically, the two shared many similarities that neither of them were aware of. Both were <a href="/wiki/Half-blood" title="Half-blood">half-blood</a> wizards who grew up among <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">Muggles</a>. Both of their Muggle caretakers were cruel to them (Snape's father was implied to be abusive to Snape and his mother, while <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">the Dursleys</a> were neglectful towards Harry). Both Snape and Harry's childhoods involved <a href="/wiki/Petunia_Dursley" title="Petunia Dursley">Petunia Evans</a> (Snape was friends with Petunia's sister Lily, while Harry was Petunia's nephew). Both grew up wearing secondhand clothes (however, Snape was likely forced to wear them due to his family's poverty, Harry's relatives were simply reluctant to afford any major expenses on him). In addition, the two grew up virtually friendless until attending <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> (Snape due to his unstable family life and secondhand clothes, Harry due to his relatives isolating him). Upon entering Hogwarts, Snape and Harry were bullied mercilessly, in Snape's case, by the <a href="/wiki/Marauders" title="Marauders">Marauders</a> (who were led by <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter I</a>), and Harry by (ironically) Snape himself, <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> , among others. Furthermore, both had at least one near-death experience during their Hogwarts: Snape was nearly killed in an abortive prank by the Marauders , while Harry repeatedly had Voldemort attempting to kill him. However, both Harry and Snape had at least one silver gleaming: their attraction to a redhead (<a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">Lily Evans</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a> , respectively). Of course, Snape did not marry Lily (who married <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a> and mothered Harry), while Harry himself did marry Ginny (with whom he had sired a child named <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">Albus Potter</a>).

<p><br />
Harry met <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a> student at Hogwarts, in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, on the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" title="Hogwarts Express">Hogwarts Express</a>. Although Harry found the younger witch rather strange, he was grateful when she told him that she believed his claim that <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> had returned, as she seemed to be one of the few students who did. Harry and Luna became friendlier through <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>, and after they fought together at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, Luna comforted Harry over the loss of his <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">godfather</a>, telling him about her late <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood%27s_mother" title="Luna Lovegood&#39;s mother" class="mw-redirect">mother</a>. She holds Harry's hand in the process, and they both show a some feelings for each other. The <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">following year</a>, Harry defended Luna and <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a> when <a href="/wiki/Romilda_Vane" title="Romilda Vane">Romilda Vane</a> implied they were not worth spending time with, whereas the previous year he found the two as embarrassment to his standing in front of <a href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a>, and he later on invited Luna to attend <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Slughorn</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Slug_Club_Christmas_party" title="Slug Club Christmas party">Christmas Party</a> with him.
</p><p>During the year in which Harry, Ron, and Hermione went to hunt down <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort's</a> <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>, Harry visited the Lovegood household, and found Luna decorated her bedroom with pictures of her five friends: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville. Harry found this sight to be very touching, and felt great affection for Luna. Upon learning that Luna was being held hostage by the Death Eaters, Harry felt greatly worried, to the point of feeling some pity for her father for attempting to turn the trio in for ransom, but had confidence in Luna surviving nevertheless. In the prelude to the final <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">battle</a>, Luna aided Harry in his search for <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw%27s_Diadem" title="Ravenclaw&#39;s Diadem">Ravenclaw's Diadem</a>, having been the one to inform Harry of its existence in the first place, and she <a href="/wiki/Stunning_Spell" title="Stunning Spell">Stunned</a> <a href="/wiki/Alecto_Carrow" title="Alecto Carrow">Alecto Carrow</a> when Harry was too shocked to move, which probably saved him from being held captive until <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a>'s arrival. Later when Harry was going to sacrifice himself, he realised that Luna was one of his closest friends and one of the persons he would like to see before his death.
</p><p>After the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, Luna was the only one who noticed that Harry wanted to get away from the victory party, and created a distraction so that he could go speak with Ron and Hermione in private. The two remained friends into adulthood, and Harry gave his <a href="/wiki/Lily_Potter" title="Lily Potter">daughter</a> the middle name “Luna” in honour of his friend.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/House-elf" title="House-elf">House-elf</a> <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a> became a vitally important figure in Harry's life, and their relationship played a crucial role in Harry's ultimate defeat of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>. Even before Harry freed Dobby from the slavery of the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_family" title="Malfoy family">Malfoy family</a>, in <a href="/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a>, Dobby did all he could to protect Harry from impending danger, and later displayed the strength of his <a href="/wiki/House-elf_magic" title="House-elf magic">house-elf magic</a> to protect Harry from Lucius Malfoy.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, Harry, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a>, <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dean_Thomas" title="Dean Thomas">Dean Thomas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Garrick_Ollivander" title="Garrick Ollivander">Garrick Ollivander</a> and the goblin <a href="/wiki/Griphook" title="Griphook">Griphook</a> were captured and taken hostage at the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_Manor" title="Malfoy Manor">Malfoy Manor</a>. Alerted to their whereabouts by <a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth Dumbledore</a>, Dobby rescued the hostages in two groups, first <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">apparating</a> Dean, Luna and Ollivander to <a href="/wiki/Shell_Cottage" title="Shell Cottage">Shell Cottage</a>, then returning to do the same for Hermione, Ron, Harry and Griphook. Dobby dropped a chandelier on <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a> to release Hermione from being held at knife-point, giving Ron the opportunity to take a wand and disapparate with Hermione. Enraged by what he had done, Bellatrix threw the same silver knife at Dobby, mortally wounding him, just as he disapparated with Harry and Griphook. Upon arriving at Shell Cottage, Harry discovered Dobby's wound and cried out for help as Dobby died in Harry's arms. Harry dug a grave without using magic and held a small <a href="/wiki/Funeral_of_Dobby" title="Funeral of Dobby">funeral</a> for the elf in the garden of <a href="/wiki/Shell_Cottage" title="Shell Cottage">Shell Cottage</a>. Dobby's epitaph read "<i>Here lies Dobby, A Free Elf</i>".

</p><p>It was the <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">grief</a> Harry felt for Dobby's death that ultimately grounded him, ridding Harry of the "<i>weird, obsessive longing</i>" to find the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a> and the resentment for how little he felt Albus Dumbledore had actually disclosed during their time together. While digging Dobby's grave, Harry reflected on all Dumbledore had said about love, and all he had foreseen, and replaced his trust in the late Headmaster, making the conscious decision to continue his pursuit of <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>, and not <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Hallows</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a> became Harry's room mate in <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a>, in their first year at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>, Harry learned that <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney%27s_first_prophecy" title="Sybill Trelawney&#39;s first prophecy">The Prophecy</a> that prompted Lord Voldemort to target his parents could have been referring to Neville. Though Harry sympathised with the fact that Neville's parents had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix, Rodolphus and Rabastan <a href="/wiki/Lestrange_family" title="Lestrange family">Lestrange</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Jr." title="Bartemius Crouch Jr.">Barty Crouch Jr</a>, he spent part of the journey to Hogwarts prior to his sixth year pondering how things could have been different if Voldemort had chosen to attack Neville, and he had become the "<i>one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord</i>" instead of Harry.
</p><p>In the initial years, Harry was quite friendly with Neville, though he was not as close to him as he was with Ron and Hermione. Harry helped out Neville in many occasions, such as in <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, when he advised him to stand up to Draco Malfoy, who constantly bullied him. Harry and Neville became close friends only in their fifth year at school, when Neville took part in <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>, an organisation that Harry led and taught in opposition to <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>. Neville became highly devoted to the D.A., which, along with Harry's encouragement, helped Neville not only improve his magical abilities, but gain badly needed confidence and incredible courage. He fought alongside Harry in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, where Neville saved Harry's life from the Death Eater <a href="/wiki/Walden_Macnair" title="Walden Macnair">Walden Macnair</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, was one of only three D.A. members who still checked their <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army_coin" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army coin">enchanted coin</a> enough to receive Hermione's call for help prior to the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Astronomy_Tower" title="Battle of the Astronomy Tower">Battle of the Astronomy Tower</a>.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, when Harry, Ron and Hermione were on the run, Neville re-formed Dumbledore's Army with <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a>, in resistance against <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> <a href="/wiki/Alecto_Carrow" title="Alecto Carrow">Alecto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amycus_Carrow" title="Amycus Carrow">Amycus Carrow</a>. Neville spoke out against their anti-<a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">Muggle</a> rhetoric and habit of using the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> on students, regardless of the consequences, saying he noticed it always helped give people hope when Harry did that. When Harry returned, Neville deferred to his leadership and summoned the rest of Dumbledore's Army (who, in turn, contacted the Order of the Phoenix) believing Harry was there to lead a revolt. Harry and Neville fought together throughout the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, and just before Harry sacrificed himself, he left Neville with the instruction to kill <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a>, Voldemort's snake and last remaining <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcrux</a>. When everyone believed Harry to be dead, Neville openly defied Voldemort, who tried to burn him alive with the <a href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a> but failed due to Harry's <a href="/wiki/Sacrificial_protection" title="Sacrificial protection">sacrificial protection</a>. Using the opportunity given to him by the sudden arrival of reinforcements, Neville completed the task Harry gave to him; he drew <a href="/wiki/Godric_Gryffindor%27s_Sword" title="Godric Gryffindor&#39;s Sword" class="mw-redirect">Gryffindor's Sword</a> from the Sorting Hat and slew Nagini, destroying the last Horcrux and rendering Voldemort mortal, thus allowing Harry to finally kill him.
</p><p>Nineteen years after the battle, Neville was the <a href="/wiki/Herbology" title="Herbology">Herbology</a> teacher at Hogwarts, and taught Harry and Ginny's children, James and Albus. They both remain close friends in adulthood. Harry made Neville the godfather to his second son Albus.

<p><a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> became Harry's rival almost from the moment they met at <a href="/wiki/Madam_Malkin%27s_Robes_for_All_Occasions" title="Madam Malkin&#39;s Robes for All Occasions">Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions</a> in <a href="/wiki/Diagon_Alley" title="Diagon Alley">Diagon Alley</a>. Draco came from a family that believed strongly in the importance of <a href="/wiki/Blood_purity" title="Blood purity" class="mw-redirect">blood purity</a>, thus he considered himself superior to most people, bullying and insulting <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-borns</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindors</a> in particular. He was bitterly jealous of Harry's seemingly effortless heroism. Despite his strong hatred towards Draco, Harry had some restraint towards Draco's taunts, occasionally restraining <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a> (and on one occasion, <a href="/wiki/George_Weasley" title="George Weasley">George Weasley</a>) from attacking him and only resorted to violence on him if Draco provoked or insulted him. Draco bit off more than he could chew in his ambition to be like his father, <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a>, when he became a <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eater</a> at a young age; to punish his father, Voldemort ordered Draco to assassinate <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, threatening his parents' lives if he failed. Although he let several Death Eaters into Hogwarts in <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, Draco found himself unwilling to actually go through with killing Dumbledore, even when given the opportunity to do so. A year later, when Harry was brought to the Malfoy Manor to be handed over to the Dark Lord, Draco was very reluctant to identify him, and during the confrontation that ensued, Harry disarmed him, winning both his hawthorn wand and, unknowingly, the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a>.
</p><p>During the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry, Ron and Hermione saved his life twice: against Crabbe's Fiendfyre and from a masked Death Eater. Because of his family's switching of sides during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, Draco was not sent to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> for his crimes. By <a href="/wiki/2017" title="2017">2017</a>, he was married and had a <a href="/wiki/Scorpius_Malfoy" title="Scorpius Malfoy">son</a>. Draco saw Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Ron at King's Cross Station when sending their children to <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, where he gave them a curt nod. While Draco and Harry eventually made peace, they never became friends. It is also unknown if Harry ever gave Draco his original wand back, as Harry won it's allegiance and it is never stated how a wand that has been won behaves towards his original master afterwards.

<p>In his earlier years at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, Harry was attracted to <a href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a>, a popular girl in <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a> House and seeker of their <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> team who is one year older than him.

</p><p>In their next year, following Cedric's tragic death, Harry and Cho grew closer, eventually sharing a kiss under the mistletoe. However, Cho was still mourning Cedric, and became unreasonably jealous of Harry's friendship with Hermione, which, compounded with Harry’s inexperience with girls, put a strain on their relationship; Harry, unimpressed with Cho's attitude and started to see her in a more negative light when the misunderstanding soured their first date's experience.

<p>Although Harry was still attracted to Cho it said that his stomach reacted less violently when she was around, merely doing a "feeble lurch" rather than a somersault. The last straw was Cho's friend <a href="/wiki/Marietta_Edgecombe" title="Marietta Edgecombe">Marietta Edgecombe</a>'s betrayal of <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a> to <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>; Cho defended Marietta and called the <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army_parchment_jinx" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army parchment jinx">jinx</a> Hermione had placed on the D.A. parchment a "horrible trick", both of which angered Harry.

<p>One of the many points that Harry fell in love with Ginny is because she was rarely weepy. This contrasts with Cho, as she cried openly for many periods of time after Cedric's death, to which left Harry at a complete loss as to what to do at such moments. Along with Cho's desire to talk about Cedric's death with Harry (to which Harry refused), Harry's confusion and awkwardness turned to sheer annoyance, and he began to lose interest in her more and more for spoiling the mood, until finally he was too irritated at her tears when she cried at how Harry insulted Marietta, and told her off rudely.

In the latter incident, Harry, who had been hurrying towards Voldemort in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Hall" title="Great Hall">Great Hall</a>, noticed the danger to Ginny's life and made a beeline for Bellatrix instead. He was beaten to her, however, by <a href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">Molly Weasley</a>'s abrupt intervention.
</p><p>Though she spoke disparagingly of the fact that Harry was a <a href="/wiki/Half-blood" title="Half-blood">Half-blood</a>, and vehemently denied Harry's claims that Voldemort was the same, Bellatrix despised Harry mostly out of loyalty to her master, the man with whom she had developed an obsessive infatuation. As such, Bellatrix more or less hated anyone who challenged or threatened <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>. Regardless of his feelings, Harry recognized that Bellatrix made a fearsome opponent; while he hated her as his godfather's killer, he acknowledged that she was also a witch of "<i>prodigious</i>" skill and absolutely no conscience.
</p><p>As Harry's hate towards Bellatrix is prominent amongst the many other Death Eaters, he tends to focus on her whenever her picture was shown in the Daily Prophet, or when her name comes up. It was due to this relationship that he saw the resemblance between Bellatrix and her younger sisters, <a href="/wiki/Narcissa_Malfoy" title="Narcissa Malfoy">Narcissa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Andromeda_Tonks" title="Andromeda Tonks">Andromeda</a>, to the point of even nearly mistaking the latter for Bellatrix herself.

<p>Harry first heard about <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a> in <a href="/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a>, and he believed Pettigrew to have been a hero who had dared to confront the man who betrayed <a href="/wiki/James_and_Lily_Potter" title="James and Lily Potter">James and Lily Potter</a>, and been tragically killed as a result. Harry even compared Pettigrew to his good friend <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>. After <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> escaped from from <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> that same year, the alleged convict made his way to Hogwarts. Sirius supposedly had the goal of killing Harry in a crazed bid to bring <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort" class="mw-redirect">Lord Voldemort</a> back to power.
</p><p>Towards the end of the school year, Black managed to pull <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a> through the <a href="/wiki/Whomping_Willow" title="Whomping Willow">Whomping Willow</a> and in to the <a href="/wiki/Shrieking_Shack" title="Shrieking Shack">Shrieking Shack</a>, followed closely by <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> and an incensed Harry. When they were joined shortly after by <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a>, he and Sirius revealed a completely different truth: Pettigrew had been the one to betray Harry's parents, and had subsequently framed Sirius by pretending to confront him, then faked his own death by cutting off one of his own fingers and hiding in his unregistered <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagus</a> form as Ron's pet rat, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Scabbers</a>. Although Harry was disgusted by Pettigrew's disloyalty and cowardice, he convinced Sirius and Remus not to become murderers, and instead force Pettigrew to face justice in the hands of the Dementors. Though Pettigrew escaped, making it impossible to prove Sirius Black's innocence, Harry's decision to spare his life was not fruitless: Pettigrew owed Harry a <a href="/wiki/Life_debt" title="Life debt">Life debt</a>.
</p><p>Pettigrew, who had fled to <a href="/wiki/Albania" title="Albania">Albania</a> and sought protection from Sirius in the service of Lord Voldemort, returned to <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> in <a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a>. After Harry and <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a> were transported to the <a href="/wiki/Little_Hangleton_graveyard" title="Little Hangleton graveyard">Little Hangleton graveyard</a> following the end of the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>, Pettigrew murdered Cedric, bound Harry to the grave of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Sr." title="Tom Riddle Sr.">Tom Riddle Sr.</a>, and concocted a <a href="/wiki/Regeneration_Potion" title="Regeneration Potion" class="mw-redirect">potion</a> using the senior Riddle's bones, one of Pettigrew's own hands, and Harry's blood, to return Voldemort to physical form. When instructed by Voldemort to give Harry back <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_wand" title="Harry Potter&#39;s wand">his wand</a>, Pettigrew did so without looking at him.
</p><p>In 1998, during the <a href="/wiki/Skirmish_at_Malfoy_Manor" title="Skirmish at Malfoy Manor">Skirmish at Malfoy Manor</a>, Peter Pettigrew's life debt was repaid; Harry reminded him that he had saved his life, and Pettigrew momentarily hesitated in the midst of attempting to strangle him. As a result, the <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew%27s_silver_hand" title="Peter Pettigrew&#39;s silver hand">silver hand</a> Voldemort had made for Pettigrew, as a reward for sacrificing his own, saw the hesitation as sign of weakness, and turned against him. Though Ron and Harry both tried to save him, the hand ultimately strangled Pettigrew to death.

<p>Harry soon encountered Umbridge again when she was appointed <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher at Hogwarts, by the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry</a>.

<p>Umbridge monitored all incoming and outgoing mail, resulting in the injury of Harry’s owl, <a href="/wiki/Hedwig" title="Hedwig">Hedwig</a>, and she made it nearly impossible for Harry, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> to visit <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a> at his <a href="/wiki/Hagrid%27s_Hut" title="Hagrid&#39;s Hut">hut</a>. When Harry publicly recounted witnessing Voldemort's resurrection in an interview with <a href="/wiki/Rita_Skeeter" title="Rita Skeeter">Rita Skeeter</a>, published in <a href="/wiki/The_Quibbler" title="The Quibbler">The Quibbler</a>, Umbridge banned him from <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> trips. One by one, Umbridge was robbing Harry of his reasons to want to stay at Hogwarts.
In order to offer students the practical defensive education Umbridge was denying them, Harry formed and led <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>. When they were betrayed to Umbridge by <a href="/wiki/Marietta_Edgecombe" title="Marietta Edgecombe">one</a> of their members, Harry was nearly expelled from Hogwarts until Dumbledore convinced <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a> that Harry only formed the organisation on his orders. Dumbledore was forced to leave Hogwarts to avoid being sent to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>, after which Umbridge took the position of Headmistress and the students took to making things as difficult for her as possible.
</p><p>Umbridge attempted to have <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a> arrested after a couple of <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">Nifflers</a> were released in her office, despite his obvious innocence, which resulted in his going on the run and Professor <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">McGonagall</a> being seriously injured and temporarily disabled at <a href="/wiki/St_Mungo%27s_Hospital_for_Magical_Maladies_and_Injuries" title="St Mungo&#39;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries">St Mungo's Hospital</a>. With seemingly no adults left for him to turn to, Harry attempted to use Umbridge’s fire, the only fire not being monitored by the Ministry, to check on <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, after having a vision that Sirius was being tortured in the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a>. Remembering that <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> was, in fact, a member of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>, Harry gave Snape the cryptic message, "<i>he's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden!</i>" Umbridge nearly used the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> on Harry in order to make him explain his statement, when Hermione intervened and tricked Umbridge into believing the D.A. had been building a weapon for Dumbledore in the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a>. When Harry, Hermione, and Umbridge were confronted by a herd of <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest_Centaur_colony" title="Forbidden Forest Centaur colony">centaurs</a>, Umbridge's angry diatribe — in which she referred to the centaurs as "<i>creatures of near-human intelligence</i>" and "<i>filthy half-breeds</i>" — resulted in her being carried off into the depths of the forest.
</p><p>After the Ministry finally acknowledged Voldemort’s return to power, Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts. However, Harry was furious to learn later that year that Umbridge was still working for the Ministry. When Voldemort became the de facto Minister for Magic, with an <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">imperiused</a> <a href="/wiki/Pius_Thicknesse" title="Pius Thicknesse">Pius Thicknesse</a> as his puppet, Umbridge, knowingly or not, immediately showed sympathy for his agenda by taking part in the hunt for Harry Potter and branding him "Undesirable Number 1<i>.</i>" When Harry, disguised as <a href="/wiki/Albert_Runcorn" title="Albert Runcorn">Albert Runcorn</a> by way of <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a>, met Umbridge again in <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, she had become Head of the <a href="/wiki/Muggle-Born_Registration_Commission" title="Muggle-Born Registration Commission">Muggle-Born Registration Commission</a>, and was cruelly interrogating and "trying" innocent Muggle-born wizards and witches, before sentencing them to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> for "stealing magic". When Umbridge taunted a Muggle-born <a href="/wiki/Mary_Cattermole" title="Mary Cattermole">witch</a> by claiming <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_locket" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s locket">Salazar Slytherin's locket</a> was a family heirloom and proof of her relation to the <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood" title="Pure-blood">pure-blood</a> <a href="/wiki/Selwyn_family" title="Selwyn family">Selwyn family</a>, Harry <a href="/wiki/Stunning_Spell" title="Stunning Spell">stunned</a> Umbridge in a fit of anger. Hermione replaced the locket with a <a href="/wiki/Geminio" title="Geminio" class="mw-redirect">decoy</a>, after which she, Ron, and Harry proceeded to free all the Muggle-borns awaiting interrogation.
</p><p>After the Second Wizarding War, Umbridge was given a life sentence in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> in regards to her crimes against humanity.

<p>Harry first saw the real <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody</a> shortly after <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Jr." title="Bartemius Crouch Jr.">Barty Crouch Jr.</a> was revealed to have been keeping Moody imprisoned in his own <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody%27s_trunk" title="Alastor Moody&#39;s trunk" class="mw-redirect">trunk</a>, using his hair for <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a>, and taking Moody's place as temporary <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher at Hogwarts for most of the <a href="/wiki/1994%E2%80%931995_school_year" title="1994–1995 school year">1994–1995 school year</a>.
</p><p>The real Moody brought the <a href="/wiki/Advance_Guard" title="Advance Guard">Advance Guard</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> to <a href="/wiki/Privet_Drive" title="Privet Drive">Privet Drive</a> in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, to safely transport Harry to the Order's headquarters, and <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>'s ancestral home, at <a href="/wiki/12_Grimmauld_Place" title="12 Grimmauld Place">12 Grimmauld Place</a>. As Harry got to know Moody through his time spent around the Order, Moody proved every bit the great, albeit incredibly paranoid, wizard he was reputed to be. When Moody was killed by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Seven_Potters" title="Battle of the Seven Potters">Battle of the Seven Potters</a>, Harry was shocked and horrified by the abrupt end of such a skilled Auror, and shared a drink in his honour with the rest of the Order.
</p><p>When Harry, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> infiltrated the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> in 1997, to steal <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin" title="Salazar Slytherin">Salazar Slytherin</a>'s locket from <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>, Harry found Moody's <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody%27s_magical_eye" title="Alastor Moody&#39;s magical eye">magical eye</a> lodged in the door to Umbridge's office. Harry reclaimed the eye, though doing so ended up alerting the Ministry to the breach in security, and later buried it under "<i>the oldest, most gnarled and resilient-looking</i>" tree he could find, marking the spot with a small cross. Little though it was, Harry was certain Moody would prefer it to having his eye put to use spying for Dolores Umbridge.

<p>Harry and <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>, were, for better or worse, rivals throughout Harry's <a href="/wiki/1993-1994_school_year" title="1993-1994 school year" class="mw-redirect">third</a> and <a href="/wiki/1994-1995_school_year" title="1994-1995 school year" class="mw-redirect">fourth</a> years at Hogwarts. As Cedric was seeker of the <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff_Quidditch_team" title="Hufflepuff Quidditch team">Hufflepuff Quidditch team</a>, one of their first encounters involved Cedric catching the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Snitch" title="Golden Snitch">snitch</a> and securing the win for his team, while Harry fell off his <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broomstick</a> after one of the <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> guarding the school found its way onto the Quidditch field.
</p><p>The next year, when both Harry and Cedric were declared Champions in the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>, Cedric was the school's obvious favourite, as most of the students believed Harry had entered the competition illegally. Cedric also believed Harry had entered illegally and asked him how he managed to do it, but Cedric did not hate Harry for this, as much of the school did. Though the negative attention abated slightly after Harry's stellar performance in the first task, Cedric also beat Harry to the punch in asking <a href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Yule_Ball" title="Yule Ball">Yule Ball</a>. And although Cedric remained good-natured and gracious throughout, Harry could not help feeling jealous, and even slightly insecure about the fact that Cedric "looked the part" of a Champion.
</p><p>Regardless, when <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a> showed Harry that the Tournament's first task would involve facing <a href="/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragons</a>, Harry felt compelled to help Cedric, realising he alone would be unprepared, as both Heads of other the two competing schools had seen the dragons as well. Cedric reciprocated by helping Harry with the second task, and during the third, each had occasion to save the other's life. As, such, when they reached the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Cup" title="Triwizard Cup">Triwizard Cup</a> at the same time, they agreed to take it together; both boys were transported to the <a href="/wiki/Little_Hangleton_graveyard" title="Little Hangleton graveyard">Little Hangleton graveyard</a>, and Harry watched in horror as <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a> murdered Cedric on Voldemort's command to "<i>kill the spare.</i>" When Cedric's ghostly image emerged from Voldemort's wand, which was locked in <a href="/wiki/Priori_Incantatem" title="Priori Incantatem">Priori Incantatem</a> with Harry's, he asked Harry to take his body back to his parents, which Harry honoured, risking his life in the process.
</p><p>Cedric's death haunted Harry's dreams well into the summer, as <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley</a> mockingly asked him if "Cedric" was his boyfriend, and enabled Harry to see <a href="/wiki/Thestral" title="Thestral">Thestrals</a> for the first time at the beginning of his <a href="/wiki/1995%E2%80%931996_school_year" title="1995–1996 school year">fifth</a> year.
</p><p>Having witnessed Cedric's death firsthand made Harry feel very distraught throughout the following year, and aside from Ron and Hermione, he refused to talk about it with anyone else, as he rebuked <a href="/wiki/Zacharias_Smith" title="Zacharias Smith">Zacharias Smith</a>'s demands for more details, and even when a tearful Cho asked of it.

<p><a href="/wiki/Kreacher" title="Kreacher">Kreacher</a> was the last in a line of <a href="/wiki/House-elf" title="House-elf">house-elves</a> who served the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Black" title="House of Black">Black family</a>, inherited by <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, and eventually by Harry. In his fanatical loyalty to the House of Black, Kreacher mimicked the family's <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood" title="Pure-blood">Pure-blood</a> supremacist views, and as such, despised Sirius for being a "blood traitor" and for supposedly breaking <a href="/wiki/Walburga_Black" title="Walburga Black">his mother's</a> heart. By extension, he hated, and muttered profanities about, anyone associated with Sirius, particularly Harry and the motley crew of blood statuses that made up the rest of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>.
</p><p>For his part, Sirius saw too much of the family he hated in Kreacher, and had no problem treating Kreacher with utter disdain. After the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, Harry learned that Kreacher had helped trick Harry into going to the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> by pretending Sirius was not at Grimmauld Place when Harry tried to find him, and thus helped bring about Sirius's end. In his will, Sirius left everything he owned to Harry, including Kreacher. As Harry wanted nothing to do with the house-elf, but couldn't risk setting him free and letting any information Kreacher had about the Order fall into the hands of the <a href="/wiki/Lestrange_family" title="Lestrange family">Lestranges</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_family" title="Malfoy family">Malfoys</a>, he sent Kreacher to work in the Hogwarts' kitchens.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, when Harry, Ron and Hermione hid in <a href="/wiki/12_Grimmauld_Place" title="12 Grimmauld Place">12 Grimmauld Place</a> at the start of their hunt for Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>, they discovered that "R.A.B" stood for <a href="/wiki/Regulus_Black" title="Regulus Black">Regulus Arcturus Black</a>, and Harry remembered actually having seen and tried to open <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_Locket" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s Locket" class="mw-redirect">Salazar Slytherin's Locket</a> in the summer of <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>. They asked Kreacher if he knew where the locket came from and what had become of it, and the house-elf was forced to reveal all that had happened between him, Voldemort, and Regulus Black; when Regulus was still a <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eater</a>, Voldemort told him he required the service of a house-elf, and Regulus volunteered Kreacher for the job. Voldemort took Kreacher to a <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Cave" title="Crystal Cave">seaside cave</a>, where he ordered Kreacher to drink an <a href="/wiki/Drink_of_Despair" title="Drink of Despair">emerald green potion</a>. Kreacher was tortured by the potion, and then left to die in the hands of the <a href="/wiki/Inferius" title="Inferius">Inferi</a>; he was only able to survive and Disapparate out of the cave because <a href="/wiki/Regulus_Black" title="Regulus Black">his master</a> called him home. Regulus became disillusioned by Voldemort's ill-treatment of Kreacher, and soon after, deduced both the existence of Voldemort's horcruxes and the fact that the magic that binds a house-elf to obey their master would supersede the cave's magical protections. Regulus then had Kreacher return with him to the cave, but instead of forcing Kreacher to suffer the effects of the <a href="/wiki/Drink_of_Despair" title="Drink of Despair">potion</a> again, ordered Kreacher to leave the cave with the locket, and destroy it as soon as he could. To protect Kreacher and his family, Regulus forbade Kreacher to tell any member of the House of Black what had happened. Kreacher took the locket and attempted to destroy it, but not before watching in horror as Regulus drank the potion himself, and was killed by the Inferi.
</p><p>Though he initially didn't want to admit it, Harry realised that Kreacher playing a crucial role in leading Sirius to his death was something that could have, and should have, been avoided. When Kreacher finished his story, Harry, with Hermione's guidance, made an effort to show the distraught house-elf kindness, comforting him about Regulus' death and even giving him Regulus' fake locket; the miserable, wretched house-elf they had known became almost unrecognisable. Kreacher told the trio that <a href="/wiki/Mundungus_Fletcher" title="Mundungus Fletcher">Mundungus Fletcher</a> had taken the locket, and gladly obeyed Harry's order — which Harry made a point of phrasing as a request — to find Fletcher and bring him to Grimmauld Place.
</p><p>From that point on, Kreacher happily tidied up the house and fed the trio, until they accidentally broke the <a href="/wiki/Fidelius_Charm" title="Fidelius Charm">Fidelius Charm</a> on 12 Grimmauld Place, and were forced to flee. Kreacher later led the Hogwarts house-elves, in the name of Harry, "<i>defender of house-elves</i>", and brave Regulus Black, in a fervent attack on the invading Death Eaters during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>.

<p>Harry first met <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a> in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>, when he accompanied Albus Dumbledore in attempting to persuade the old <a href="/wiki/Potions_master" title="Potions master" class="mw-redirect">Potions master</a> to come out of retirement. From the start, Harry was unsure how he felt about Slughorn; though he was clearly not someone with even the slightest inclination toward becoming a <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eater</a>, he seemed wholly more superficial and self-serving than the likes of people in the Order and most of Harry's other professors. Slughorn had a habit of nurturing and promoting students who would allow him to benefit from his connections to them later on; on the other hand, he seemed to take into account genuine merit as much status within the wizarding community, as he told Harry that his mother, who had no connections at all as a Muggle-born witch, was one of his all time favourite students.
</p><p>Though he resisted, Slughorn ultimately could not pass up the opportunity to "collect" Harry, nor could he deny that there was no safer place to be than where ever Dumbledore was. Horace Slughorn resumed his post as Potions Master, and made quick work of inviting several choice students (which included <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>, when he saw her perform an excellent <a href="/wiki/Bat-Bogey_Hex" title="Bat-Bogey Hex">Bat-Bogey Hex</a> on <a href="/wiki/Zacharias_Smith" title="Zacharias Smith">Zacharias Smith</a>, and later <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a>, the best in her year) in addition to Harry, to be a part of his Slug Club.
</p><p>In due course, Harry realised that Dumbledore had not just wanted Slughorn back at Hogwarts because he needed to fill a position. During one of their <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_Albus_Dumbledore%27s_private_lessons" title="Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore&#39;s private lessons">private lessons</a>, Dumbledore showed Harry a <a href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">memory</a> that belonged to Horace Slughorn, in which Slughorn was chatting with a group of <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> boys, including a young <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a>. Riddle had apparently gifted Slughorn his favourite <a href="/wiki/Crystallised_pineapple" title="Crystallised pineapple" class="mw-redirect">Crystallised pineapple</a>, was being being charming, and generally seemed to be building up to something. Indeed, when the other boys left, Riddle stayed behind, and slowly but surely made his way to his point; he wanted to know what Slughorn knew about <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>. The room suddenly got hazy, and a voice that belonged to Slughorn but was clearly inorganic reprimanded Riddle for asking such a thing, before the memory abruptly ended.

<p>Dumbledore told Harry that original version of the modified memory would be of vital importance in understanding exactly what destroying Voldemort would entail, and tasked Harry with retrieving it. Aside from simply being "Harry Potter", Harry had three things that would help him do what even Dumbledore apparently could not: a reputation with Slughorn as an excellent potioneer, courtesy of the <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape%27s_copy_of_Advanced_Potion-Making" title="Severus Snape&#39;s copy of Advanced Potion-Making">Half-Blood Prince</a>, the vial of <a href="/wiki/Felix_Felicis" title="Felix Felicis">liquid luck</a> he had won, also courtesy of the Prince, and Slughorn's fondness for Harry's own <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">mother</a>. A combination of all those things, as well as a healthy dose of <a href="/wiki/Mead" title="Mead">Mead</a> and the opportunity to collect a few vials of <a href="/wiki/Acromantula_venom" title="Acromantula venom">Acromantula venom</a>, allowed Harry to finally collect the memory that confirmed what Dumbledore had suspected Voldemort had done to travel "<i>farther down the path to immortality than anyone else</i>"; created not just one, but several <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>.
</p><p>Though it seemed as if Slughorn had fled with the rest of the Slytherins prior to the start of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, he soon returned with reinforcements from <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a>. During the final battle in the Great Hall, Slughorn displayed his immense skill and courage by taking on Voldemort directly, duelling him alongside <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kingsley_Shacklebolt" title="Kingsley Shacklebolt">Kingsley Shacklebolt</a>.

<p>By the summer of <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> was in stubborn denial of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort's</a> <a href="/wiki/Rebirth_of_Tom_Riddle" title="Rebirth of Tom Riddle">return</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a>, whether out of self-delusion or genuine paranoia, seemed to suspect <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> may have been making false claims as a pretext for mobilising the students of <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a> in a coup against Fudge's administration. As such, the Ministry saw fit to appoint one of its own to fill a vacancy in the Hogwarts faculty; at the start of the <a href="/wiki/1995%E2%80%931996_school_year" title="1995–1996 school year">1995–1996 school year</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> was announced as the school's new <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> professor, and later, the first and only known <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_High_Inquisitor" title="Hogwarts High Inquisitor">Hogwarts High Inquisitor</a>.
</p><p>As Umbridge steadily asserted her authority into nearly every aspect of life at Hogwarts — from refusing to allow her D.A.D.A. students anything beyond a <a href="/wiki/Defensive_Magical_Theory" title="Defensive Magical Theory">basic theoretical education</a> and <a href="/wiki/Educational_Decree_Number_Twenty-Four" title="Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four">disbanding</a> all student organisations, clubs, societies, and teams, to enforcing a unique form of <a href="/wiki/Blood_Quill" title="Blood Quill" class="mw-redirect">corporal punishment</a> — most of the residents of Hogwarts quickly turned against her.
</p><p>Harry was the most heatedly vocal among her opposition, followed closely by <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>, who had been the first to notice and question the fact that Umbridge's outlined curriculum did not seem to include the actual use of defensive magic. The two of them, along with <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, founded <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a> (so named to mock "the Ministry's worst fear") to secretly provide students a practical defensive education. When an unexpectedly high number of students arrived at the <a href="/wiki/Hog%27s_Head" title="Hog&#39;s Head" class="mw-redirect">Hog's Head</a> pub for the introductory meeting of the D.A., Harry suspected that many of the attendees were only interested in hearing the details of <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>'s death. However, nearly all of the members worked in earnest to improve their <a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">duelling</a> skills, crediting their marked successes to Harry's effective teaching, and many were eventually able to produce corporeal <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronuses</a> under Harry's tuition.
</p><p>The organisation was disbanded in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Marietta_Edgecombe" title="Marietta Edgecombe">Marietta Edgecombe</a> gave into pressure from her parents and Umbridge to betray the <a href="/wiki/Room_of_Requirement" title="Room of Requirement">location</a> of the D.A.'s secret meetings, which nearly resulted in the expulsion of all of the members. Dumbledore ultimately took the blame (citing the fact that it was called "<i>Dumbledore's Army, not Potter's</i>"), and overpowered several Ministry officials to avoid being subsequently sent to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>.
</p><p>Only <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>, <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a> continued to check their <a href="/wiki/Enchanted_coin" title="Enchanted coin">Enchanted coins</a> and were able to answer Hermione and Ron's call prior to the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Astronomy_Tower" title="Battle of the Astronomy Tower">Battle of the Astronomy Tower</a>. Nevertheless, all of the former members, aside from Marietta Edgecombe and <a href="/wiki/Zacharias_Smith" title="Zacharias Smith">Zacharias Smith</a>, reunited when the D.A. was re-formed in <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, co-led by Neville, Ginny and Luna in Harry, Ron, and Hermione's absence, and fought together in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>.

<p>Harry first heard about the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, a year after Lord Voldemort's return.

<p><a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth</a> was <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>'s younger brother. Though Harry, Ron and Hermione had known him for years as the owner of the <a href="/wiki/Hog%27s_Head" title="Hog&#39;s Head" class="mw-redirect">Hog's Head</a>, they didn't officially meet him or learn his true identity until <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, when Harry, Ron and Hermione apparated outside of Aberforth's pub, in <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a>. Harry had read about Aberforth in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Life_and_Lies_of_Albus_Dumbledore" title="The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore">The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore</a></i>, a book <a href="/wiki/Rita_Skeeter" title="Rita Skeeter">Rita Skeeter</a> had written, which described Aberforth as unlettered, rude, and bitter for having lived in the shadow of his elder brother. When the trio apparated outside of the Hog's Head, they set off a <a href="/wiki/Caterwauling_Charm" title="Caterwauling Charm">Caterwauling Charm</a> set by <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>. As the three were hidden beneath Harry's <a href="/wiki/Cloak_of_Invisibility" title="Cloak of Invisibility">Invisibility cloak</a>, the Death Eaters used Dementors to smoke them out; the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> recognised Harry's stag Patronus, but Aberforth claimed it was he who had set off the Caterwauling charm, and that the Patronus had actually been a goat.
</p><p>Upon taking refuge in the Pub, the trio discovered Aberforth had saved their lives once before; he had been able to send <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a> to save them from the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_Manor" title="Malfoy Manor">Malfoy Manor</a> after Harry called to him through the broken shards of the <a href="/wiki/Two-way_mirror" title="Two-way mirror">Two-way mirror</a>, as Aberforth had bought Sirius' mirror from <a href="/wiki/Mundungus_Fletcher" title="Mundungus Fletcher">Mundungus Fletcher</a>. Aberforth advised Harry to take Ron and Hermione away from Hogsmeade, and to save himself. He told them about his family life, and that his sister, <a href="/wiki/Ariana_Dumbledore" title="Ariana Dumbledore">Ariana</a>, had been so traumatised after being attacked by three <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">Muggle</a> boys, that she became unable to control her magical abilities. He also told them why <a href="/wiki/Percival_Dumbledore" title="Percival Dumbledore">his father</a> had been imprisoned in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>, and about the events leading up to the deaths of <a href="/wiki/Kendra_Dumbledore" title="Kendra Dumbledore">his mother</a> and sister. Though Harry understood, or at least sympathised with, Aberforth's bitterness, he echoed Albus' sentiments by saying "<i>sometimes you've </i>got<i> to think about the greater good!</i>" Harry then informed Aberforth that, despite what he believed of his brother, Albus had never been free of what <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a> had done to Aberforth or what had happened to Ariana, referring to all Harry had heard Albus saying under the effects of the <a href="/wiki/Drink_of_Despair" title="Drink of Despair">Drink of Despair</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Cave" title="Crystal Cave">Crystal Cave</a>. After receiving this insight into his brother's mind, Aberforth showed the trio the secret passage to the <a href="/wiki/Room_of_Requirement" title="Room of Requirement">Room of Requirement</a> concealed behind <a href="/wiki/Ariana_Dumbledore" title="Ariana Dumbledore">Ariana</a>'s portrait.

<p>Harry first met <a href="/wiki/Kingsley_Shacklebolt" title="Kingsley Shacklebolt">Kingsley Shacklebolt</a> when he and the rest of the <a href="/wiki/Advance_Guard" title="Advance Guard">Advance Guard</a> arrived at Privet Drive in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>. Kingsley was an <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a> who believed in equality and fairness for all <a href="/wiki/Wizards" title="Wizards" class="mw-redirect">wizards, witches,</a> and <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">Muggles</a>. He later saved countless lives by sending his Patronus to warn the attendees of the <a href="/wiki/Wedding_of_William_Weasley_and_Fleur_Delacour" title="Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour">Weasley-Delacour Wedding</a> that the Ministry had fallen, and with it, the protections surrounding <a href="/wiki/The_Burrow" title="The Burrow">The Burrow</a>. After the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding War</a>, Kingsley became <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a>.
</p><p>Before Harry had even known he was a wizard, <a href="/wiki/Dedalus_Diggle" title="Dedalus Diggle">Dedalus Diggle</a> had met and even publicly bowed to a bemused, young Harry, much to <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">the Dursley</a>'s confusion and disgust. In <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, Diggle and <a href="/wiki/Hestia_Jones" title="Hestia Jones">Hestia Jones</a> took the Dursleys into hiding under the Order's protection from Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Hestia was furious when she realised how little Harry's Uncle and Aunt seemed to know or care about him, and was unimpressed by Dudley's attempt at reconciliation. Though Harry was mostly amused by Dudley's declaration that he didn't consider Harry a "waste of space", he probably appreciated Hestia's indignation on his behalf all the same.
</p><p>Harry thought <a href="/wiki/Arabella_Figg" title="Arabella Figg">Arabella Figg</a> was just his odd, cat-loving neighbour, until <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, when he learned she was a <a href="/wiki/Squib" title="Squib">Squib</a>, and a member of the Order. She was outraged to learn that <a href="/wiki/Mundungus_Fletcher" title="Mundungus Fletcher">Mundungus Fletcher</a> had abandoned his post when he was supposed to be guarding Harry, which left the boy and his cousin vulnerable when they were attacked by Dementors. Figg also participated in Harry Potter's trial, as a witness in Harry's defence. It is unknown if Figg fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, though it is likely that she didn't fight, as she lacked magical powers.
</p><p>Harry had learned from Moody that several members of the First Order had been killed during the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Fabian_Prewett" title="Fabian Prewett">Fabian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gideon_Prewett" title="Gideon Prewett">Gideon Prewett</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Bones" title="Edgar Bones">Edgar Bones</a> and his family, <a href="/wiki/Marlene_McKinnon" title="Marlene McKinnon">Marlene McKinnon</a> and her family, <a href="/wiki/Caradoc_Dearborn" title="Caradoc Dearborn">Caradoc Dearborn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Benjy_Fenwick" title="Benjy Fenwick">Benjy Fenwick</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dorcas_Meadowes" title="Dorcas Meadowes">Dorcas Meadowes</a>. In Harry's fourth year, Dumbledore told him that <a href="/wiki/Alice_and_Frank_Longbottom" title="Alice and Frank Longbottom">Alice and Frank Longbottom</a> had been tortured to insanity and were permanently incapacitated in <a href="/wiki/St_Mungo%27s_Hospital_for_Magical_Maladies_and_Injuries" title="St Mungo&#39;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries">St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries</a>, shortly after Voldemort's fall, by four Death Eaters who were attempting to discover their Master's whereabouts. Harry was later confused when he heard about the arrest of Order member <a href="/wiki/Sturgis_Podmore" title="Sturgis Podmore">Sturgis Podmore</a>, who had apparently been attempting to break into the Department of Mysteries in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, but eventually realised that Podmore had been <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">imperiused</a>. Harry also learned about the death of <a href="/wiki/Emmeline_Vance" title="Emmeline Vance">Emmeline Vance</a> in the Daily Prophet, when she was killed around the same as the murder of <a href="/wiki/Amelia_Bones" title="Amelia Bones">Amelia Bones</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Mundungus_Fletcher" title="Mundungus Fletcher">Mundungus Fletcher</a> was likely the member of the Order Harry liked least (barring, initially, <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>), as he was a criminal who callously pilfered many of Sirius' inherited possessions very shortly after his death.

Lockhart was extremely vain and highly self-obsessed; he assigned all of his own, very expensive, books for his class.

<p>Harry met the <a href="/wiki/Helena_Ravenclaw" title="Helena Ravenclaw">Grey Lady</a> in <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>.

Her admitting she had in fact divulged its whereabouts to a young <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> led Harry to realise where Riddle must have hidden it, and he assured Helena that she was neither the first nor the last to fall prey to Tom Riddle's charms.

<p>Harry had a mixed relationship with the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, Harry had his first run-in with the Ministry after <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a> had smashed a pudding in his Aunt and Uncle’s house. Although the incident was not Harry’s fault, the Ministry believed that Harry had used magic illegally while under-age, and given him an official warning.
</p><p>A year later, Harry lost his temper and blew up his <a href="/wiki/Marjorie_Dursley" title="Marjorie Dursley">"Aunt" Marge</a>. Believing that this time he would surely be expelled from Hogwarts, Harry went on the run and boarded the <a href="/wiki/Knight_Bus" title="Knight Bus">Knight Bus</a>, but ran into <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a>, then Minister for Magic, who seemed strangely unconcerned by what Harry had done.

<p>However, by <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, the relationship between Fudge and Harry was not so rosy. Harry had witnessed Voldemort’s return to power, which he told both <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> and Fudge. The latter stoutly refused to believe Harry, and branded Dumbledore and Harry as liars/nutters in a <a href="/wiki/Campaign_to_discredit_Albus_Dumbledore_and_Harry_Potter" title="Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter">smear campaign</a>. In the summer of 1995, Harry performed a Patronus Charm to save <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley Dursley</a> and himself from Dementors, for which Harry was unreasonably threatened with expulsion from <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, tried by the entire <a href="/wiki/Wizengamot" title="Wizengamot">Wizengamot</a>. Though Harry was cleared of all charges, thanks to Dumbledore's defence and <a href="/wiki/Amelia_Bones" title="Amelia Bones">Amelia Bones</a>'s impartiality, Fudge took his revenge by employing his undersecretary <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> as <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> Professor and <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_High_Inquisitor" title="Hogwarts High Inquisitor">High Inquisitor</a> of Hogwarts. Umbridge sadistically <a href="/wiki/Blood_Quill" title="Blood Quill" class="mw-redirect">tortured</a> Harry when he repeatedly contradicted the Ministry’s opinion that Voldemort had not returned. In <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>, after Dumbledore’s Army was discovered, Fudge came to Hogwarts to expel Harry, but Dumbledore claimed the D.A. had been formed on his orders. Though Harry was allowed to remain at Hogwarts, Dumbledore was forced to go on the run after overpowering several ministry officials. Later that year, toward the end of <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, Fudge arrived at the Ministry in time to see Voldemort <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">disapparate</a> with <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>, and was forced to acknowledge that Dumbledore and Harry had been telling the truth all along. As the wizarding community had lost all confidence in him, he was forced to resign as <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a>.
</p><p>Fudge's successor, <a href="/wiki/Rufus_Scrimgeour" title="Rufus Scrimgeour">Rufus Scrimgeour</a>, did little to improve Harry's view of the Ministry. Scrimgeour asked Harry to essentially become the Ministry's mascot for the purpose of restoring public confidence, despite all they had done to Harry and the fact that Dolores Umbridge was still in their employ. Harry refused, stating he couldn't pretend to approve of the ministry's methods, showing Scrimgeour the scars on the back of his hand, and citing the fact that Scrimgeour was arresting innocent people like <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Shunpike" title="Stanley Shunpike">Stan Shunpike</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, Voldemort and his Death Eaters took over the Ministry, and killed the Minister after torturing him in an attempt to ascertain Harry’s whereabouts. Although Harry did not like Scrimgeour, who hardly appeared to care at all about what actually happened to Harry or his friends, he was incredibly grateful that the Minister's final act had been to protect him.
</p><p>After <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_the_Ministry_of_Magic" title="Fall of the Ministry of Magic">Lord Voldemort’s takeover of the Ministry</a>, with an <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperiused</a> <a href="/wiki/Pius_Thicknesse" title="Pius Thicknesse">Pius Thicknesse</a> acting as Voldemort's puppet Minister for Magic, Harry’s relationship with the Ministry was worse than ever before. They named Harry Potter "Undesirable Number 1" and claimed he was wanted for questioning about the death of Albus Dumbledore.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, after Voldemort's death, the position of Minister of Magic went to <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> member and Harry's friend <a href="/wiki/Kingsley_Shacklebolt" title="Kingsley Shacklebolt">Kingsley Shacklebolt</a>, who later employed Harry as an <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> were dark wizards under the orders of Voldemort during both wizarding wars; known Death Eaters included <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a>. Though not all of Harry's enemies were Death Eaters, the ones who most persistently and ferociously pursued Harry and his friends were part of Voldemort's inner circle.
</p><p>The first of Voldemort's servants to try to murder Harry was his <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> Professor, <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a>. Though not a Death Eater, he encountered Voldemort in the forests of <a href="/wiki/Albania" title="Albania">Albania</a>, and was seduced into the Dark Lord's service by promises of wealth and power. Harry found out about Quirrell's true loyalties at the end of his <a href="/wiki/1991-1992_school_year" title="1991-1992 school year" class="mw-redirect">first year</a>, in the seventh of the <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone_Chambers" title="Philosopher&#39;s Stone Chambers" class="mw-redirect">Philosopher's Stone Chambers</a>. This news also came with the discovery that Voldemort was actually sharing Quirrell's body, and the turban Quirrell wore was, in fact, hiding Voldemort's face on the back of Quirrell's head. When Quirrell attempted to grab Harry, he found he was unable to do so without experiencing unbearable pain, due to the power of Harry's mother's <a href="/wiki/Sacrificial_protection" title="Sacrificial protection">Sacrificial protection</a>. Voldemort detached himself from his servant to escape the pain and fled before <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>'s arrival because Dumbledore could have killed him, leaving Quirrell to die.

<p>Harry first learned about the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> after the <a href="/wiki/Riot_at_the_Quidditch_World_Cup" title="Riot at the Quidditch World Cup" class="mw-redirect">1994 Quidditch World Cup Riot</a>, where <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Jr." title="Bartemius Crouch Jr.">Barty Crouch Jr.</a> raised the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a> in the sky. At the end of Harry's <a href="/wiki/1994%E2%80%931995_school_year" title="1994–1995 school year">fourth year</a>, he realised that the man he thought was <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a> was actually Barty Crouch Jr., disguised by way of <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a>. Crouch attempted to kill Harry, but Professors <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">McGonagall</a> and <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a> rushed into Moody's office and stunned him.

<p>Harry first saw <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> in <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a> at <a href="/wiki/Borgin_and_Burkes" title="Borgin and Burkes">Borgin and Burkes</a>, though they didn't officially meet until Lucius got into a fist fight with <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> at <a href="/wiki/Flourish_and_Blotts" title="Flourish and Blotts">Flourish and Blotts</a>, over Malfoy's many insults aimed at the Weasley family. Though Harry didn't know it till much later, after a good deal of damage had been done, Malfoy had used the scuffle as a pretext for handing <a href="/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" title="Ginny Weasley" class="mw-redirect">Ginny Weasley</a> a book that turned out to be <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle%27s_Diary" title="Tom Riddle&#39;s Diary" class="mw-redirect">Tom Riddle's Diary</a>. Harry and Malfoy met again at the end of the same year, when Harry tricked Malfoy into freeing his <a href="/wiki/House-elf" title="House-elf">House-elf</a>, Dobby; when Lucius threatened Harry in his anger at having lost his servant, Dobby demonstrating the might of his <a href="/wiki/House-elf_magic" title="House-elf magic">House-elf magic</a> to protect Harry. They would eventually meet again in the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>, in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, after which Lucius was outed as an active Death Eater and arrested. Following his failure at the Ministry, and Voldemort's discovery of the fact that Lucius had allowed one of his <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a> to be destroyed, Voldemort punished him by giving his son the seemingly impossible task of assassinating <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Astronomy_Tower" title="Battle of the Astronomy Tower">Battle of the Astronomy Tower</a>, Harry got his first glimpse of <a href="/wiki/Fenrir_Greyback" title="Fenrir Greyback">Fenrir Greyback</a>, who was known for craving human flesh even out of <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">Werewolf</a> form, as well for planning his attacks by positioning himself near his intended victims prior to the full moon (typically the children of his employer's enemies). Harry, Ron and Hermione were taken hostage by Greyback and a gang of <a href="/wiki/Snatchers" title="Snatchers">Snatchers</a> just before the <a href="/wiki/Skirmish_at_Malfoy_Manor" title="Skirmish at Malfoy Manor">Skirmish at Malfoy Manor</a>, during which time Greyback expressed a disturbing interest in Hermione. Though he wasn't a Death Eater, and lacked the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a> <a href="/wiki/Tattoo" title="Tattoo">tattoo</a>, Greyback was allowed to wear Death Eater's robes whenever Voldemort made use of him.

<p>Harry met <a href="/wiki/Durmstrang_Institute" title="Durmstrang Institute">Durmstrang Institute</a>'s Headmaster, <a href="/wiki/Igor_Karkaroff" title="Igor Karkaroff">Igor Karkaroff</a>, in <a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a>, during the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>. Harry later saw Karkaroff in Dumbledore's <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore%27s_Pensieve" title="Albus Dumbledore&#39;s Pensieve" class="mw-redirect">pensieve</a> bearing witness against several of his fellow Death Eaters, in exchange for his own freedom. Karkaroff fled after Voldemort's resurrection in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>. Two years later, Harry learned that Karkaroff's corpse was found in a shack in the north of Britain.
</p><p>Harry didn't initially think highly of <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>'s younger brother, <a href="/wiki/Regulus_Black" title="Regulus Black">Regulus</a>, who followed the family tradition of zealous pure-blood supremacy for most of his life. However, <a href="/wiki/Kreacher" title="Kreacher">Kreacher</a> later revealed to Harry, Ron and Hermione that Regulus had likely been the first to deduce the existence of Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>, and subsequently attempted to find and destroy them. When he located the hiding place of <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_locket" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s locket">Salazar Slytherin's locket</a>, rather than force Kreacher to consume the <a href="/wiki/Drink_of_Despair" title="Drink of Despair">Drink of Despair</a> as Voldemort had done, Regulus drank it himself after ordering Kreacher to take and destroy the locket, resulting in Regulus' death. In all likelihood, Harry came to appreciate Regulus' bravery, and respect the level of compassion he had for beings that had long been ill-treated by wizarding kind.

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_(name)" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Harry (name)">Harry</a> is the Middle English form of the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_(given_name)" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Henry (given name)">Henry</a>, derived from the Germanic name <i>Heinrich,</i> from the words <i>heim,</i> meaning "home", and <i>ric</i>, meaning "power, ruler". It has been a very popular name in the English-speaking world for centuries. Harry can also be a diminutive form of the name Harold, from the Old English name <i>Hereweald</i>, meaning "leader of the army". It has been the name of five kings of Norway, three kings of Denmark, and two kings of England.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[84]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[85]</a></sup> In an interview J. K. Rowling stated that 'Harry' had always been one of her favourite boy's names and that if her daughter had been a son she would have named him 'Harry', although then she would have to have come up with a different name for the books as it <i>"would have been too cruel to name him after my own son".</i> <sup id="cite_ref-accio-quote.org_85-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-accio-quote.org-85">[86]</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_(name)" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:James (name)">James</a> is derived from the same Hebrew name as Jacob, meaning “holds the heel” (in the Genesis narrative, Jacob was born grasping Esau′s heel and later bought his birthright). The name came into English language from the French variation of the Late Latin name Iacomus, a dialect variant of Iacobus, from the New Testament Greek Ἰάκωβος (Iakōbos), from Hebrew word יעקב (Yaʻaqov). James is Harry's middle name, James was the name of his father and is also the name of his first son.
</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potter" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Potter">Potter</a> is a very common surname of English origin.<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[87]</a></sup> It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrix_Potter" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Beatrix Potter">Beatrix Potter</a> was a well-known English children's author. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potter%27s_Field" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Potter&#39;s Field">Potter's Field</a> is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans; the Potter family had many members that fit that description.

</li><li>In the whole Harry Potter series, Harry has only called Draco Malfoy by just his first name two times.
<ul><li>The first time was when they were in detention in the Forbidden Forest in their first year.
</li><li>The second and last time he called Draco Malfoy by his first name was during the final duel with Voldemort in the Great Hall, when Harry talked about the mastery of the Elder wand. He said that Voldemort wasn't the master of the Elder Wand, Draco was.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Harry is right-handed. He tells this to Mr Ollivander in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></i>. He is also seen writing with this hand throughout the film series.
</li><li>He often describes various parts of his anatomy as feeling like <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a>.
</li><li><a href="/wiki/Josh_Herdman" title="Josh Herdman">Josh Herdman</a> plays Harry when he is disguised as <a href="/wiki/Gregory_Goyle" title="Gregory Goyle">Gregory Goyle</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">Chamber of Secrets</a>,</i> as does <a href="/wiki/David_O%27Hara" title="David O&#39;Hara">David O'Hara</a> when he is disguised as <a href="/wiki/Albert_Runcorn" title="Albert Runcorn">Albert Runcorn</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i>. The <a href="/wiki/Saunders_Triplets" title="Saunders Triplets" class="mw-redirect">Saunders Triplets</a> play Harry as an infant in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone (film)">Philosopher's Stone</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Toby_Papworth" title="Toby Papworth">Toby Papworth</a> plays Harry as an infant in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</a></i>.

This is the only time Harry does this.
</li><li>Daniel Radcliffe and Harry were both born in July — Harry on the 31st and Daniel on the 23rd.
</li><li>Harry has green eyes, but in the films he has blue eyes. This is due to the fact that Daniel Radcliffe was allergic to the contact lenses. Radcliffe also has brown hair, as opposed to Harry's black hair, and also has a strong physical body, rather than the slim frame Harry is described as having. However Harry is only described as having an uncommonly 'slim' frame in the earlier installments, so it is possible that he bulked out a little into a lean frame as he matured.
</li><li>Harry's birthday of 31 July is also the birthday of <i>Harry Potter</i> author, <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a>, and actor <a href="/wiki/Richard_Griffiths" title="Richard Griffiths">Richard Griffiths</a> who plays Harry's Uncle <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Vernon Dursley</a> in the Harry Potter films.
</li><li>In the <a href="/wiki/Mirror_of_Erised" title="Mirror of Erised">Mirror of Erised</a>, Harry saw his family, a lot of people with untidy black hair, his own noses, mouths and knees. However, he also saw some people with almond-shaped green eyes, which could indicate that he saw his <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">Muggle</a> family as well, even though he did not see the <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">Dursley family</a>. All people were smiling at him, so there is a thought that all of his family, Wizards and Muggles, are proud of him.

<ul><li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">film version</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, Harry is seen practising <a href="/wiki/Lumos_Maxima" title="Lumos Maxima">Lumos Maxima</a> under the covers in his bedroom, but Harry does not get a letter from the <a href="/wiki/Improper_Use_of_Magic_Office" title="Improper Use of Magic Office">Improper Use of Magic Office</a> even though he is under-age, however, judging by the book he is reading, his reason for doing so is most likely for homework. In the book he is simply using a torch (or flashlight if you're American) while writing his homework for <a href="/wiki/History_of_Magic" title="History of Magic">History of Magic</a>.
</li><li>While Harry repeatedly states <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> is the best student in his year in all classes, he has beaten her in two of the three Defence Against the Dark Arts exams they had together, with Hermione only beating him in their first year exam. In addition, <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> has said that Harry could have beat Hermione in a magical duel halfway through Prisoner of Azkaban.<sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[89]</a></sup> Part of this can be put down to <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Professor Lupin</a>'s way of teaching, as it seemed to help bring out Harry's own talent at the subject. It is probably more accurate to say that Hermione is the best student in every subject but DADA, in which Harry is strongest; hence, in Harry's mind she is the best student overall.
</li><li>Harry's niece and nephew, <a href="/wiki/Rose_Weasley" title="Rose Weasley">Rose</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Weasley" title="Hugo Weasley">Hugo</a>, have some of the same heritage of Harry. A <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a> mother, <a href="/wiki/Lily_Evans" title="Lily Evans">Lily</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood" title="Pure-blood">pure-blood</a> father, <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>. This makes Rose, Hugo and Harry all half-bloods.
</li><li>When Harry is cleaning out his school trunk in 1997, he finds a "Support Cedric Diggory!" badge in there. Considering the badges were only created by <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> to get a rise out of Harry in 1994, it seems out of place that Harry has it, although he may have it by accident, or out of respect for Cedric. He could also have kept one as a memento from the Tournament.
</li><li>Throughout the films, Harry's hair grows longer and longer (the longest point was in the Goblet of Fire) until it was cut for the Order of the Phoenix. It has since grown to about the same length as it was for the Prisoner of Azkaban.
</li><li>In the films, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_scars" title="Harry Potter&#39;s scars">Harry's scar</a> is off-centre on his forehead; this was apparently done at <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a>'s request: because of the books' artwork, many fans believe the scar is in the centre of his head. But it is never explicitly mentioned where the scar is located. On all the U.S. book covers (illustrations), the scar on Harry's forehead is located in the centre. The same is definitely true of the last two U.K. instalments; however, on early U.K. book covers, Harry's scar tends to appear slightly off-centre. It is somewhat hard to tell on most of these covers, as Harry's face is only visible in profile. However, on the U.K. cover of Chamber of Secrets, Harry's scar is decidedly off-centre. It is perhaps of this book that Rowling was thinking.

They will always bicker, there will always be rough edges there, but they are pulled together, each has something the other needs. [Kloves] felt a certain pull between them at that point. And I think he's right. There are moments when [Harry and Hermione] touch, which are charged moments. One when she touches his hair as he sits on the hilltop reading about Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and [two] the moment when they walk out of the graveyard with their arms around each other. Now the fact is that Hermione shares moments with Harry that Ron will never be able to participate in. He walked out. She shared something very intense with Harry. So I think it could have gone that way".<sup id="cite_ref-HAH_81-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HAH-81">[82]</a></sup>
</li><li>The only person Harry ever considered killing by use of curse was <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> and possibly <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>, ironically to avenge Sirius. It is, however, unclear if Harry knew how to cast the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Avada Kedavra</a> curse since he was not taught the <a href="/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses" title="Unforgivable Curses">Unforgivable Curses</a> until his fourth year. Furthermore, when Harry found out that <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a> was the one who had betrayed his parents to Voldemort, he did not want Sirius and <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> to kill Pettigrew in revenge. Even during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, in which Harry defeated <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, Harry did not do so by use of any curse intended to do harm to his opponent, but rather he used his "trademark", <a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">Expelliarmus</a>. Harry finished Voldemort by reflecting a curse Harry would never use on another, even his mortal enemy. This suggests the <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a>, which is "the power the Dark Lord knows not..." makes it difficult for Harry to kill. Even during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Seven_Potters" title="Battle of the Seven Potters">Battle of the Seven Potters</a>, Harry illustrated his unwillingness to kill <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>. During that battle the Death Eaters were masked at the time, he could not know who was a willing follower and who was a controlled drone. However in the example with Voldemort, Harry knew Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">killing curse</a> would backfire, so rather than use the same curse which would make him look somewhat bad, he instead decided to use the <a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">Disarming Charm</a> to gain possession of the wand.
</li><li>Harry usually has the last line in every Harry Potter film. Though it could be debatable on whether he has the last line of the second film since the closed captions say that Dean said, "Yes!", so he may have had the last line.

</li></ul>
</li><li>A running gag in the books is the messiness of Harry's hair. In the films, this is not mentioned except for a reference in the fourth film. Harry notices that Hagrid has combed his hair so he will look good for <a href="/wiki/Olympe_Maxime" title="Olympe Maxime">Olympe Maxime</a>. When Harry says to him, <i>"Hagrid, have you combed your hair?!"</i> Hagrid states, <i>"As a matter of fact, I have. You might wanna try the same thing now and again".</i>

</li><li>Both <a href="/wiki/Michael_Corner" title="Michael Corner">Michael Corner</a> and Harry have dated the same girls, but in a different order, Cho Chang and Ginny Weasley.
</li><li>Despite being a talented Quidditch player (and the team Seeker, considered the most important player on the team), Harry never played a full season (every minute of all three matches):
<ul><li>In his first year, he was recuperating in the hospital wing after saving the Philosopher's Stone, and thus missed the final match.
</li><li>In his second year, the final match of the season was cancelled due to the attack on Hermione and <a href="/wiki/Penelope_Clearwater" title="Penelope Clearwater">Penelope Clearwater</a>.
</li><li>In his third year, Harry came closest to playing a full season, but spent the last few seconds of the opening Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff match unconscious after being attacked by Dementors.
</li><li>In his fourth year, the Quidditch Cup was cancelled due to the Triwizard Tournament.
</li><li>In his fifth year, Harry was banned by Dolores Umbridge after the opening Gryffindor vs. Slytherin match.
</li><li>In his sixth year, Harry was knocked unconscious partway through the second match of the season against Hufflepuff, and then held in detention for the final match against Ravenclaw.
</li></ul>
</li><li>J.K. Rowling has said that because of the demands of his life, Harry has had less sexual experience than boys of his age might have had.<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[91]</a></sup>
</li><li>J.K. Rowling has said that Harry's glasses are a clue to his vulnerability.<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91">[92]</a></sup>

</li><li>Like his parents, Harry personally defied Voldemort three times before defeating him the fourth time: once in the Philosopher's Stone Chambers, once at the cemetery in Little Hangleton, and once again during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. However, there were five previous encounters, if one counts the events of Harry's second year with <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle%27s_Diary" title="Tom Riddle&#39;s Diary" class="mw-redirect">Tom Riddle's Diary</a>, though that was a memory instead of the real Voldemort, and the night his parents were killed in <a href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hallow" title="Godric&#39;s Hallow" class="mw-redirect">Godric's Hallow</a>.
</li><li>Harry learns a new mode of transportation in every book.
<ul><li>In his first year, he learns to travel by <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broomstick</a>.
</li><li>In his second year, he travels by <a href="/wiki/Floo_Powder" title="Floo Powder">Floo Powder</a>.
</li><li>In his third year, he travels on the <a href="/wiki/Knight_Bus" title="Knight Bus">Knight Bus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a> the <a href="/wiki/Hippogriff" title="Hippogriff">hippogriff</a> lets him take a ride on his back.
</li><li>In his fourth year, he gets to the <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_World_Cup" title="Quidditch World Cup">Quidditch World Cup</a> by <a href="/wiki/Portkey" title="Portkey">portkey</a>.
</li><li>In his fifth year, he travels to the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> by <a href="/wiki/Thestral" title="Thestral">thestral</a>.
</li><li>In his sixth year, he learns to <a href="/wiki/Apparation" title="Apparation" class="mw-redirect">Apparate</a>.
</li><li>In the seventh book, he breaks into <a href="/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank" title="Gringotts Wizarding Bank">Gringotts</a> and flies out on a <a href="/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a>.
</li></ul>
</li><li>The only autograph he ever gave out was to <a href="/wiki/Colin_Creevey" title="Colin Creevey">Colin Creevey</a>.
</li><li>In <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2: Behind the Magic</i>, the person who makes all the wands for the films revealed that Dan has gone through over 80 wands over the course of the ten years because he drums with them.
</li><li>A variant of Harry is available in the "Downloadable Character Pack" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Downloadable content">DLC</a> for <i><a href="/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter:_Years_5-7" title="LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7">LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7</a></i>. The variant is called "Harry (Yule Ball)" because it portrays Harry wearing the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_dress_robes" title="Harry Potter&#39;s dress robes">dress robes</a> he wore to the <a href="/wiki/Yule_Ball" title="Yule Ball">Yule Ball</a>.
</li><li>In the <i>Half-Blood Prince</i> film, Harry tells Dumbledore at the train station that he likes riding around on trains as it takes his mind off things.
</li><li>Interestingly, in several meanings of his name, Harry, it is something to do with ruling, mighty in war or war chief; this pretty much describes his character.
</li><li>Daniel Radcliffe said in an interview that Daphne seemed to have adopted him like another father. Interestingly, Daphne plays Daniel's (Harry's) daughter.<sup class="noprint">&#91;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" class="extiw exitstitial" title="wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs references to reliable sources." style="white-space: nowrap;">citation needed</span></i></a>&#93;</sup>
